### 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX
**Focus: Capacity Gaps & Specialized Tech Needs (2025-2026)**

*   **[Hiring]: AI & Data Expansion**
    *   **The Evidence:** Active recruitment for "Machine Learning Consultant" and "SAP BI Developer" in Graz and Vienna.
    *   **The Source:** [DCCS Careers Portal - Machine Learning Consultant](https://www.dccs.eu/en/career/jobs)
    *   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Data Science & ML (Generative AI / OpenAI)

*   **[Service Model]: "Rent an Agile Team"**
    *   **The Evidence:** DCCS explicitly markets a "Rent an Agile Team" service, validating they operate on a staff augmentation model similar to Localhost. This signals potential for **sub-contracting partnerships** when they are over-capacity.
    *   **The Source:** [DCCS Services - Rent Agile Teams](https://www.dccs.eu/en/solutions/rent-agile-teams)
    *   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Application Development (Staff Augmentation)

*   **[Ecosystem]: Microsoft Solutions Partner**
    *   **The Evidence:** Deeply entrenched Microsoft shop (Gold/Solutions Partner) focusing on Azure Cloud Modernization and .NET development.
    *   **The Source:** [Microsoft Partner Profile / DCCS Solutions](https://www.dccs.eu/en/solutions/software-modernization)
    *   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Cloud DevOps (Azure, Bicep)

*   **[Tech Stack]: Modern Web Frontend Needs**
    *   **The Evidence:** Job listings for ".NET Full Stack Developer" specifically requesting **React** and **Angular** expertise, indicating a hybrid stack environment.
    *   **The Source:** [DevJobs.at - DCCS Listings](https://devjobs.at/company/dccs-gmbh)
    *   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Frontend Development (React, Angular)

*   **[Strategic Shift]: Low-Code Integration**
    *   **The Evidence:** Promoting "Low Code Solutions" (Webcon) alongside custom dev.
    *   **The Source:** [DCCS Low Code Solutions](https://www.dccs.eu/en/solutions/low-code-solutions)
    *   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Application Development (Power Fx/Low-code alternatives)

### 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Backend:** C#, .NET Core, Java (Spring).
*   **Frontend:** React, Angular.
*   **Cloud/Infra:** Azure, Kubernetes, Docker.
*   **Data/AI:** OpenAI, SQL Server.

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **Low-Code:** They use **Webcon**; Localhost supports **Power Fx**. (Migration or integration opportunity).
*   **ERP:** They have heavy **SAP** integration needs; Localhost focuses on **Salesforce**. (Potential to handle the non-SAP CRM side of their client projects).

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **Legacy/Niche:** SharePoint on-premise maintenance (if applicable), specific SAP modules not covered by general backend skills.

### 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The "Overflow" Partner (Competitor-to-Partner)**
*   **The Trigger:** Your "Rent an Agile Team" offering is scaling, and you are actively hiring for .NET/React Full Stack roles in Graz/Vienna.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Service providers often face "feast or famine" cycles where demand outstrips local hiring speed, risking client delivery timelines.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** Localhost can serve as your **white-label overflow partner**. We have ready-to-deploy .NET/Azure pods that integrate into your delivery structure immediately, allowing you to say "Yes" to new business without waiting on headcount.

**Conversation Starter 2: AI Specialization**
*   **The Trigger:** We noticed your push into "AI Custom Solutions" and the search for Machine Learning Consultants.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Sourcing senior AI talent (specifically for Generative AI/OpenAI integration) is the biggest bottleneck in the DACH region right now.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** Localhost specializes in **Generative AI (Langchain/OpenAI)**. We can handle the complex RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture for your clients while your team manages the core application integration.

**Conversation Starter 3: Cloud Modernization Support**
*   **The Trigger:** Your focus on "Software Modernization" (Legacy to Cloud).
*   **The Logical Friction:** Migrating legacy monoliths to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) often requires heavy DevOps lifting (Bicep/Terraform) that distracts developers from feature work.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** Our **Cloud DevOps squad** can handle the infrastructure-as-code (IaC) and pipeline setup (GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps) for your modernization projects, accelerating your delivery velocity.
