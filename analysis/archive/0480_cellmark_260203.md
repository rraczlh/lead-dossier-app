### 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX

**[ERP Modernization]: JD Edwards Orchestrator & Digital Platform**
*   **The Evidence:** CellMark relies on **JD Edwards EnterpriseOne** as their core ERP. Recent technical updates (2024-2025) indicate a shift toward using **Orchestrator** for process automation and **REST API** integrations to expose ERP logic to external "Digital Meeting Points."
*   **The Source:** [CellMark Financial Summary 2024 / Quest Oracle Community Updates](https://www.cellmark.com)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** **Oracle** (Database Optimization) & **.NET Core** (Building external API wrappers).

**[Data Strategy]: ESG Data Compliance (EcoVadis Gold 2025)**
*   **The Evidence:** CellMark retained its **EcoVadis Gold Rating for 2025**. This certification requires rigorous, auditable data regarding supply chain emissions and compliance, necessitating complex data ingestion pipelines beyond simple spreadsheets.
*   **The Source:** [CellMark Sustainability News - Aug 2025](https://www.cellmark.com)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** **Python/Pandas** (Data Engineering) & **Generative AI** (Automated document parsing for compliance).

**[Leadership Signal]: New CEO Mandate (Oct 2025)**
*   **The Evidence:** Doug Smith was appointed CEO in late 2025. Leadership transitions in logistics firms almost always trigger a "Digital Audit" to identify efficiencies in the low-margin trading business.
*   **The Source:** [CellMark Press Release - Oct 2025](https://www.cellmark.com)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** **Application Development** (Rapid prototyping for "Quick Wins").

### 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Oracle Database:** The underlying engine for their JD Edwards ERP.
*   **.NET Core / C#:** The standard extension language for their Gothenburg-based engineering teams and Microsoft-centric infrastructure.
*   **React / Angular:** Required for their "Digital Meeting Point" customer portals to provide a modern UX over the legacy ERP.
*   **SQL Server:** Often used alongside Oracle in their hybrid data environments.

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **JD Edwards Orchestrator:** They use this for logic; we can build the **Node.js** or **.NET** consumers that trigger these orchestrations.
*   **Qlik:** They likely use Qlik for BI. We can offer **Python** data engineering services to clean and structure the data *before* it hits Qlik, or migrate specific dashboards to **React**-based custom views.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **Legacy AS/400 (IBM i):** While JD Edwards can run here, we do not support RPG or IBM i infrastructure.
*   **Proprietary EDI:** We avoid legacy EDI maintenance unless wrapped in modern APIs.

### 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The "Headless" ERP Strategy**
*   **The Trigger:** Their use of JD Edwards Orchestrator to expose business logic.
*   **The Friction:** JDE's native UI is cumbersome for modern supply chain partners who demand real-time, mobile-friendly portals.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Håkan, rather than customizing JDE directly (which breaks upgrades), let's build a **React/Next.js** 'Headless' portal that talks to JDE via your existing Orchestrator APIs. We handle the frontend UX, you keep the core clean."

**Conversation Starter 2: Automating the ESG Gold Standard**
*   **The Trigger:** Retaining the EcoVadis Gold Rating in 2025.
*   **The Friction:** Collecting compliance documents from thousands of global suppliers is likely a manual, email-heavy process prone to error.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Maintaining that Gold rating gets harder as data requirements grow. We can deploy a **Python & Langchain** workflow to automatically parse incoming supplier certificates, validate them against your criteria, and flag risks before they impact your score."

**Conversation Starter 3: The New CEO's "Data Asset"**
*   **The Trigger:** Doug Smith's recent appointment as CEO.
*   **The Friction:** New CEOs need to unlock value from historical data, but it's often trapped in siloed ERP tables.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "With the leadership transition, there's likely pressure to show how data drives margin. We can deploy a small **Data Engineering pod** to unify your Oracle and SQL data sources, creating a 'Single Pane of Glass' for the new executive team without a multi-year migration."
