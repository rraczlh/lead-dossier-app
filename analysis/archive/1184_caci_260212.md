| Data Point | Excel Value | Current (Feb 2026) | Verification Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | 7000000000.0 | **8630** (Millions USD) | [CACI FY25 Earnings Report / Stock Titan](https://stocktitan.net/news/CACI/caci-reports-results-for-its-fiscal-2025-fourth-quarter-mqMw89D_j9B0.html) |
| **Key Decision Maker** | [Name] | **Jason Bales** (CTO) | [CACI Investor Relations - Feb 2026 Event](https://investor.caci.com/news/news-details/2026/CACI-to-Participate-in-Citi-2026-Global-Industrial-Tech-and-Mobility-Conference/default.aspx) |

### 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX (High-Signal Items 2025-2026)

**[Contract Award]: Navy Systems Modernization**
*   **The Evidence:** Awarded a $416 Million task order in Jan 2026 to "sustain and modernize systems" for the U.S. Navy, specifically requiring rapid software development and logistics integration.
*   **The Source:** [CACI News Release - Jan 12, 2026](https://investor.caci.com/news/news-details/2026/CACI-Awarded-a-416-Million-Task-Order-to-Sustain-and-Modernize-Systems-for-the-U.S.-Navy/default.aspx)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Application Modernization (Java/Spring Boot to Cloud Native).

**[Executive Move]: New CTO Appointment**
*   **The Evidence:** Jason Bales is identified as the new Chief Technology Officer (CTO) as of Feb 2026, replacing the long-standing Glenn Kurowski. This signals a potential shift in technical strategy or vendor consolidation.
*   **The Source:** [Business Wire - Feb 10, 2026](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260210005000/en/CACI-to-Participate-in-Citi-2026-Global-Industrial-Tech-and-Mobility-Conference)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Strategic Consulting / Cloud Architecture Review.

**[Hiring Surge]: Agile Solution Factory (ASF)**
*   **The Evidence:** Active 2026 recruitment for "Full Stack Developers" in Ashburn, VA for the BEAGLE contract. Stack specified: "PostgreSQL, Java Spring Boot, Angular, microservices architecture, AWS."
*   **The Source:** [CACI Careers - Full Stack Development](https://caci.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/External/job/US-VA-Ashburn/Full-Stack-Development_293842)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Staff Augmentation (Java/Angular Pods).

**[Tech Expansion]: Space Force Network Modernization**
*   **The Evidence:** Dec 31, 2025 award ($212M) to deliver "Secure Software-Defined Network" capabilities. This requires heavy Kubernetes and containerization work for edge computing.
*   **The Source:** [CACI Investor News - Dec 31, 2025](https://investor.caci.com/news/news-details/2025/CACI-to-Deliver-Secure-Software-Defined-Network-Modernization-Capabilities-to-the-U.S.-Space-Force/default.aspx)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** DevOps & Infrastructure (Kubernetes/Docker).

**[Innovation]: Generative AI & Deep Learning**
*   **The Evidence:** CACI is aggressively deploying its "Bluestone" analytics platform and "DarkBlue" intelligence suite, which now integrates Generative AI and Computer Vision for OSINT (Open Source Intelligence).
*   **The Source:** [CACI DarkBlue Product Page](https://www.caci.com/technology/darkblue)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Data & AI (Generative AI/LLM Integration).

### 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Backend:** Java (Spring Boot), Python (Django/FastAPI), C# (.NET Core).
*   **Frontend:** Angular (Primary for Gov contracts), React, TypeScript.
*   **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS (GovCloud focus), Azure, Kubernetes, Docker, GitLab CI, Jenkins.
*   **Data:** PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch (ELK), Kafka.
*   *Source:* [CACI Job Description: Full Stack Developer (Ashburn)](https://caci.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/External/job/US-VA-Ashburn/Full-Stack-Development_293842)

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **Legacy Migration:** They manage massive legacy ERPs (Oracle/PeopleSoft) that are actively being strangled into Microservices (Java/Spring). Localhost's "Modernization Squads" fit here.
*   **Microsoft Power Platform:** High usage of M365/SharePoint for internal Gov workflows. Localhost supports Power Fx/Power Platform.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **Hardware/RF:** RF Engineering, FPGA Design, VHDL, and Manufacturing (CACI's "Mastodon" and "Counter-UAS" hardware lines).
*   **Niche GovTech:** specialized SIGINT proprietary waveforms or classified "Black Box" hardware integration.

### 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The "Agile Solution Factory" Capacity Gap**
*   **The Trigger:** Active recruitment for the BEAGLE contract (DHS/CBP) explicitly listing Java Spring Boot/Angular microservices.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Federal "Agile" contracts often have surge requirements that internal recruiting cannot meet fast enough, especially for cleared Full Stack talent.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Jason, we see the BEAGLE teams are scaling. Localhost can deploy pre-vetted 'Spring+Angular' pods that align with your ASF (Agile Solution Factory) methodology immediately, preventing backlog drift on the DHS delivery schedule."

**Conversation Starter 2: The Space Force Kubernetes Challenge**
*   **The Trigger:** The recent $212M Space Force "Software-Defined Network" win (Dec 2025).
*   **The Logical Friction:** "Software-Defined" in a space context implies complex edge computing and container orchestration (Kubernetes) on constrained hardware, a notoriously difficult skill set to hire for.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "With the new Space Force SDN mandate, you're likely facing friction between legacy network engineering and modern K8s orchestration. Localhost's DevOps practice specializes in 'Edge-Native' Kubernetes, which could accelerate your prototype delivery for the SSC."

**Conversation Starter 3: Post-Acquisition Tech Integration**
*   **The Trigger:** The integration of Azure Summit Technology (acquired late 2024/2025) and the appointment of new CTO Jason Bales.
*   **The Logical Friction:** M&A activity creates technical debt—disparate DevOps pipelines (Azure DevOps vs. GitLab) and fragmented cloud governance.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "As you integrate the Azure Summit capabilities, are you standardizing the CI/CD pipelines across the new business units? Localhost can serve as the neutral 'Platform Engineering' partner to unify your toolchain without pulling your core R&D team off the mission-critical EW work."
