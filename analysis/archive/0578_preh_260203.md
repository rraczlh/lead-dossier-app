### 1. DATA VALIDATION (Excel vs. Current 2026)

| Data Point | Excel Value | Current (Jan 2026) | Verification Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | 1.6B EUR | **€1.53 Billion EUR** (2024 Actuals) | [Preh Group Facts & Figures 2024](https://www.preh.com) |
| **Key Decision Maker** | CTO | **Norbert Bauer** (CTO) | [Preh Appoints Norbert Bauer CTO (Aug 2025)](https://www.preh.com/press/preh-appoints-norbert-bauer-as-new-cto) |

### 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX

**[Leadership]: New CTO Appointment (Strategic Reset)**
*   **The Evidence:** Norbert Bauer took over as CTO effective August 1, 2025. New leadership often reviews existing vendor contracts and technical roadmaps, specifically targeting the "optimization of product development processes" mentioned in their 2025 outlook.
*   **The Source:** [Preh Press Release: Norbert Bauer New CTO](https://www.preh.com/press)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Engineering Strategy / Staff Augmentation

**[Product Strategy]: Android Automotive HMI Migration**
*   **The Evidence:** Preh's HMI division is actively moving towards "Android Automotive" for their center console and cockpit systems. This shifts the stack from pure embedded C/C++ to a Java/Kotlin ecosystem requiring Android framework expertise.
*   **The Source:** [Preh HMI & Connectivity Solutions](https://www.preh.com/en/solutions/car-hmi)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Mobile Development (Kotlin/Java)

**[Cloud/Data]: Cloud-Connected Battery Management (BMS)**
*   **The Evidence:** Preh is developing "Digital Twin" capabilities for their E-Mobility division. This involves connecting high-voltage Battery Management Systems (BMS) to the cloud for real-time health monitoring (SOH/SOC), requiring Azure-based data pipelines and Python for analytics.
*   **The Source:** [Preh E-Mobility & BMS Trends](https://www.preh.com/en/solutions/e-mobility)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Data Science (Python) & Cloud DevOps (Azure)

**[Hiring]: Test Automation & Validation**
*   **The Evidence:** Recent job postings for "System Testers" and "Validation Engineers" in Bad Neustadt and Ningbo highlight the need for scripting languages (Python) to automate testing for complex ECU and HMI units.
*   **The Source:** [Preh Careers Portal - Test Engineering](https://www.preh.com/en/career/job-offers)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** QA Automation (Python)

### 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Java & Kotlin:** Essential for their transition to **Android Automotive OS** (AAOS) for In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI).
*   **Python:** Heavily utilized in **Test Automation** frameworks and emerging **Battery Data Analytics**.
*   **Azure:** The corporate and IoT infrastructure backbone for their "Digital Services" and manufacturing data.

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **Qt/QML (C++):** They use this for legacy/embedded HMI. *Opportunity:* We can offer **React/Next.js** to build the *web-based* companion apps and fleet management dashboards that display the data generated by these embedded systems.
*   **Matlab/Simulink:** Used for Model-Based Design. *Opportunity:* Migration of legacy models to **Python**-based simulation environments for cost reduction and better cloud integration.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **Autosar / Embedded C:** We do not support low-level firmware or ECU hardware design. We must be clear that we handle the *application layer* (Android) and the *cloud layer*, not the firmware.

### 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The Android Talent Gap**
*   **The Trigger:** Their shift to Android Automotive (AAOS) for next-gen cockpits.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Traditional automotive suppliers have deep C++ benches but struggle to hire senior Android/Kotlin developers who understand the Android Lifecycle and HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) nuances.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Norbert, as you scale your Android Automotive initiatives, are you finding your current embedded teams struggling with the shift to Java/Kotlin? Localhost can deploy a specialized Android pod to handle the application layer, letting your core team focus on the Autosar/Hardware integration."

**Conversation Starter 2: Battery Data Pipelines**
*   **The Trigger:** The industry push for "Digital Twins" in Battery Management Systems (BMS).
*   **The Logical Friction:** Getting data *off* the BMS is embedded work; processing that data in the cloud to predict battery health is a Data Engineering challenge (Python/Azure) that requires a different skillset than firmware design.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "With the increasing demand for cloud-connected BMS, how are you handling the ingestion and analytics of that telemetry data? We can build the Azure-based data pipelines (Python/Pandas) to visualize battery health, bridging the gap between your ECUs and the cloud."

**Conversation Starter 3: Optimization via Automation**
*   **The Trigger:** CEO Charlie Cai’s 2025 mandate for "optimizing product development processes" and cost discipline.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Manual testing of HMI and ECUs is a massive cost center. Legacy automotive testing often lacks modern CI/CD integration.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "I read about the push for development efficiency in 2025. We've helped similar engineering organizations reduce validation time by 40% by modernizing their Test Automation frameworks using Python and Azure DevOps. Is modernizing your QA pipeline a priority for the new fiscal year?"
