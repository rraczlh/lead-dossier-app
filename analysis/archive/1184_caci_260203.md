### 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX
| Type | Signal Title | The Evidence | The Source | Mapping-2-Localhost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **M&A** | **Azure Summit Integration** | Acquired Azure Summit Technology ($1.275B) in late 2024 to dominate "software-defined" spectrum warfare; integration active throughout 2025. | [CACI Press Release](https://investor.caci.com) | **Application Development** (Modernizing legacy RF code to C#/.NET Core) |
| **Contract** | **NASA NCAPS Modernization** | Active execution of NASA Consolidated Applications and Platform Services (NCAPS); consolidating 200+ apps into a single "Agile-at-scale" delivery model. | [CACI Contract News](https://www.caci.com) | **Cloud/DevOps** (Kubernetes/Docker migration squads) |
| **Hiring** | **Power Platform Surge** | Multiple 2025 job requisitions for "M365 Developers" requiring Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power BI expertise. | [CACI Careers / Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/q-Caci-Software-Developer-jobs.html) | **Power Fx** (Low-code enterprise app development) |
| **Strategy** | **"Software is our Superpower"** | Former CTO Glenn Kurowski and new leadership explicitly pivoted strategy to "software-defined" everything, partnering with GitLab for DevSecOps. | [Washington Technology Interview](https://washingtontechnology.com) | **Observability/ITSM** (Integrating Monitoring into CI/CD) |
| **Hiring** | **Generative AI Trust** | Hiring "Software Engineering Interns" and Leads for AI trustworthiness, specifically mentioning Python and "human-machine delegation" frameworks. | [BuiltIn Job Board](https://builtin.com) | **Data Science/ML** (Python/Langchain for internal AI tools) |

### 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION
**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Languages:** Java (Spring Boot), C# (.NET Core), Python (AI/Scripts), TypeScript/JavaScript.
*   **Frontend:** Angular (Heavy usage in Gov contracts), React.
*   **Cloud/Infra:** AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, Docker.
*   **Low Code:** Power Fx (via Power Apps/Automate).
*   **Databases:** PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **CI/CD Migration:** They heavily utilize **GitLab** (Strategic Partner). Localhost specializes in **GitHub Actions**. *Opportunity:* Offer "GitLab-to-GitHub" migration services or demonstrate how Localhost's **Terraform/CDK** expertise integrates with their existing GitLab pipelines (since they likely use Terraform which is adjacent to CDK).
*   **Mobile:** They are hiring for **Kotlin** (Android) for tactical edge devices. Localhost supports Kotlin.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **Hardware/RF:** Heavy focus on "Digital Signal Processing," "Photonics," and "Optics" (Hardware engineering).
*   **Legacy Gov:** Mainframe maintenance (COBOL) and proprietary classified systems not listed in Localhost's matrix.

### 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE
**Conversation Starter 1: The "Software-Defined" Integration Gap**
*   **The Trigger:** The $1.2B acquisition of Azure Summit Technology to bolster "software-defined" electronic warfare.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Merging Azure Summit's proprietary hardware-adjacent code with CACI's enterprise "Agile-at-scale" standards creates massive technical debt and pipeline incompatibility.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** Localhost can deploy **C#/.NET Core modernization pods** to refactor legacy embedded software into containerized (Docker/K8s) microservices, allowing CACI's cleared teams to focus purely on the classified mission logic.

**Conversation Starter 2: NASA NCAPS Automation**
*   **The Trigger:** The NASA NCAPS contract requires consolidating 200+ applications into a unified Agile delivery model.
*   **The Logical Friction:** "Agile-at-scale" often fails without rigorous automated testing and standardized infrastructure-as-code; manual regression testing will kill their velocity.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** Propose a **"Test Automation Acceleration"** engagement using **Python and Selenium/Playwright** (mapped to Python skills) to build the QA safety net required to migrate those 200 apps to AWS/Azure without downtime.

**Conversation Starter 3: The Power Platform Backlog**
*   **The Trigger:** A surge in job reqs for "M365 Developers" and Power Automate/Apps.
*   **The Logical Friction:** High-value engineering talent is likely being wasted on low-code internal business apps, or the backlog for these "simple" apps is growing faster than they can hire.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** Localhost can provide a dedicated **Power Fx / Low-Code squad** to clear the internal IT backlog (HR, Finance, Logistics apps), freeing up their top-tier Java/C# engineers for the high-margin Intelligence Community contracts.
