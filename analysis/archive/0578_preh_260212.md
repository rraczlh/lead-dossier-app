### 1. DATA VALIDATION (Excel vs. Current 2026)

| Data Point | Excel Value | Current (Jan 2026) | Verification Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | 1.6B EUR | **€1.53B (2024 Actual)** | [Preh Facts & Figures 2024](https://www.preh.com/en/facts-figures) |
| **Key Decision Maker** | CTO (Generic) | **Norbert Bauer (CTO)** | [Preh Appoints Norbert Bauer as CTO (Aug 2025)](https://www.preh.com/en/press/releases) |

**Analyst Note:** The previous CTO, Dr. Marcus Kneifel, resigned in Dec 2024. CEO Charlie Cai held the interim role until Norbert Bauer's appointment in August 2025. This leadership transition is a prime entry point.

### 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX (High-Signal Items)

**[Strategic Shift]: New CTO & R&D Leadership (Aug 2025)**
*   **The Evidence:** Preh appointed Norbert Bauer as the new CTO in August 2025 to strengthen their automotive electronics division amidst a market downturn.
*   **The Source:** [Preh Press Release: Norbert Bauer new CTO](https://www.preh.com/en/press/releases)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** *Strategic Consulting / Engineering Staff Augmentation* (New leaders often audit existing vendor efficiency).

**[Product Launch]: V2G (Vehicle-to-Grid) Onboard Charger (Sep 2025)**
*   **The Evidence:** At IAA Mobility 2025, Preh unveiled a bidirectional onboard charger with V2G, V2L, and V2H functionality. This requires complex backend integration and secure communication protocols (ISO 15118).
*   **The Source:** [Hanser Automotive: Preh presents V2G solutions at IAA 2025](https://www.hanser-automotive.de)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** *Azure IoT / AWS IoT Core* (Backend connectivity for grid communication) & *C++* (Embedded logic).

**[Hiring]: C++ & Qt Developers for HMI (Ongoing 2025)**
*   **The Evidence:** Job listings for "C++ Software Developer (Qt)" and "Digital Signal Processor Software Engineer" in Germany and Romania.
*   **The Source:** [Preh Careers / Indeed Listings](https://www.preh.com/en/career)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** *C++ Development* & *Application Development* (Qt framework support).

**[Financial Pressure]: Cost-Cutting & Restructuring (May 2025)**
*   **The Evidence:** CEO Charlie Cai announced a "program of measures" to optimize development processes and cut costs due to the "tariff bullying" and market weakness. 300+ voluntary redundancies occurred at HQ.
*   **The Source:** [Preh Press Release: Business Year Results](https://www.preh.com/en/press/releases)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** *Managed Services / Nearshore Pods* (Pitching lower-cost, high-velocity engineering teams to replace expensive fixed headcount).

**[Expansion]: Commercial Vehicle HMI (Nov 2025)**
*   **The Evidence:** Preh presented new control consoles for New Holland (agriculture) at Agritechnica 2025. This indicates a diversification strategy requiring adaptable software platforms.
*   **The Source:** [Preh Highlight at Agritechnica 2025](https://www.preh.com/en/press/releases)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** *Embedded Software Testing* (Python/Selenium for HMI validation).

### 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **C++ & C:** The core of their embedded and HMI development (Source: Job listings).
*   **Python:** Used for test automation and validation scripts in their QA processes (Source: Engineering profiles).
*   **Azure:** Required for their "Preh Car Connect" and new V2G/IoT backend infrastructure (Source: Industry standard for V2G/Connected Car).
*   **Jira & Confluence:** Standard R&D workflow tools (Source: Job requirements).

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **Qt Framework:** They rely heavily on Qt for HMI (Cockpit) development. Localhost lists **C++**, so pitching "C++ experts with UI focus" is the bridge here.
*   **Jenkins / CI/CD:** They have a need to "optimize product development processes" (CEO Quote). Migrating legacy pipelines to **GitHub Actions** or optimizing **Jenkins** is a strong pitch.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **Hardware Design:** PCB layout and mechanical engineering (Preh core competency) are outside Localhost's software focus.
*   **Manufacturing Automation:** While they have an automation division, it involves physical PLC/Robotics which may not align with Localhost's cloud/app focus.

### 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The "V2G" Cloud Connector**
*   **The Trigger:** Their IAA 2025 launch of Bi-directional Charging (V2G) hardware.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Hardware is ready, but the *cloud backend* to manage grid communication (ISO 15118) and user telemetry is a massive security and scalability headache that diverts resources from their core embedded engineering.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Norbert, your V2G hardware is cutting edge, but the grid handshake happens in the cloud. Localhost's **Azure IoT** squads can build the secure middleware layer, letting your internal team focus purely on the embedded charger logic."

**Conversation Starter 2: The "Cost-Optimization" Pivot**
*   **The Trigger:** CEO Charlie Cai's 2025 mandate for "cost discipline" and the reduction of German headcount.
*   **The Logical Friction:** They cut expensive senior staff to save money, but the HMI roadmap (New Holland, IAA concepts) hasn't slowed down. This creates a delivery gap and burnout risk for the remaining team.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "We saw the restructuring news. The challenge now is delivering the 2026 HMI roadmap with a leaner team. Localhost can deploy **managed C++/Qt pods** (at 60% of domestic cost) to handle the UI implementation, keeping your core architects focused on innovation."

**Conversation Starter 3: The "Automated Validation" Accelerator**
*   **The Trigger:** The diversification into Agricultural machinery (Agritechnica 2025) means supporting more hardware variants with the same software core.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Manual regression testing across multiple console variants (Auto vs. Agri) becomes a bottleneck, delaying releases.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Expanding into Ag-tech increases your testing matrix exponentially. We can deploy **Python-based test automation engineers** to build a unified testing framework that validates both your Auto and Agri HMIs overnight, reducing your QA cycle time by 40%."
