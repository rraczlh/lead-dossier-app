# 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX (High-Signal Items 2025-2026)

**[Product Launch]: Bauma 2025 Digital Portfolio**
*   **The Evidence:** PERI is showcasing its next-generation digital construction tools at Bauma 2025 (April 2025), focusing on "future-proof construction" and new digital services.
*   **The Source:** [PERI at Bauma 2025 Preview](https://www.peri.com/en/company/press/press-releases/peri-at-bauma-2025.html)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Application Development (Frontend/Backend for new tools).

**[IoT & Cloud]: PERI InSite Construction (ISC) Expansion**
*   **The Evidence:** Expansion of the "InSite" sensor portfolio (Pressure, Temperature, Concrete maturity). The system explicitly relies on a "Cloud-based platform" for real-time data analysis and mobile connectivity.
*   **The Source:** [PERI InSite Construction Product Page](https://www.peri.com/en/products/digital-solutions/peri-insite-construction.html)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** AWS IoT Core / Azure IoT & Data Engineering (Python/Spark).

**[SaaS Application]: QuickSolve Web Planner Updates**
*   **The Evidence:** PERI actively maintains "QuickSolve," a browser-based 2D/3D planning tool that requires no installation. This indicates a shift from desktop CAD to heavy client-side web applications (JavaScript/TypeScript/WebGL).
*   **The Source:** [PERI QuickSolve Planner](https://www.peri-usa.com/products/applications/software/apps/peri-quicksolve.html)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Frontend Development (JavaScript/TypeScript) & Cloud Infrastructure.

**[Legacy Tech]: Java/Oracle Engineering Stack**
*   **The Evidence:** Recruitment for software engineering roles explicitly lists "J2EE," "Oracle," and "JavaScript" for their core business applications, indicating a massive legacy modernization opportunity.
*   **The Source:** [PERI Software Careers & Tech Stack](https://www.perisoftware.com/en/careers)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Backend Modernization (Java -> Spring Boot) & Database Migration.

**[3D Printing]: COBOD Partnership**
*   **The Evidence:** PERI holds a significant stake in COBOD (3D Construction Printing). These printers require sophisticated control software, likely involving Python for path planning and C++ for embedded control.
*   **The Source:** [PERI & COBOD Partnership Details](https://www.peri.com/en/business-segments/3d-construction-printing.html)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Python (Data/AI) & C++ Engineering.

# 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Java & J2EE:** Core backend systems for their enterprise resource planning and legacy tools.
*   **JavaScript / HTML/CSS:** The engine behind "QuickSolve" and their customer portals (myPERI).
*   **Oracle Database:** The data persistence layer for their legacy stack.
*   **Python:** Essential for the data analytics component of "InSite Construction" (sensor data processing).

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **Cloud (Azure/AWS):** PERI mentions a "Cloud-based platform" for InSite but doesn't publicly lock a vendor. Localhost's **Azure** or **AWS** expertise is the perfect bridge to modernize their on-premise J2EE systems.
*   **Frontend Frameworks (React/Angular):** "QuickSolve" is a complex web app. While they list "JavaScript," they are almost certainly using a modern framework like **React** or **Angular** (which we support) to handle the 3D planning logic in the browser.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **BIM & CAD (AutoCAD):** Their core engineering design relies on CAD/BIM proprietary tools which are outside Localhost's software engineering focus.
*   **SAP:** Likely used for ERP, which is not in the Localhost matrix.

# 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The "QuickSolve" Browser Performance Angle**
*   **The Trigger:** Their push for "QuickSolve" as a no-installation, web-based 3D planning tool.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Moving complex CAD-like functionality to the browser (JavaScript/WebGL) creates massive performance bottlenecks and state management issues, especially as user load scales.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** Localhost's **Frontend Engineering pods (React/TypeScript)** can refactor their rendering engine to ensure 60FPS performance on low-end tablets, increasing adoption among field contractors.

**Conversation Starter 2: The IoT Data Ingestion Challenge**
*   **The Trigger:** The expansion of "InSite Construction" sensors sending real-time pressure/temperature data to the cloud.
*   **The Logical Friction:** As sensor deployment grows, the "Cloud-based platform" will face ingestion latency and storage cost spikes. Their legacy J2EE/Oracle background may not be optimized for high-velocity time-series data.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** Localhost can deploy a **Data Modernization Squad (Python/Cloud)** to architect a serverless ingestion pipeline (AWS Lambda/Azure Functions) that scales automatically with sensor volume, reducing infrastructure costs.

**Conversation Starter 3: Legacy to Cloud Modernization**
*   **The Trigger:** Job postings referencing "J2EE" and "Oracle" alongside their modern "Digital Products" goals.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Maintaining a monolithic J2EE stack slows down the release velocity of new digital features (like those launched at Bauma 2025).
*   **The Partnership Angle:** Localhost specializes in **Java Modernization**. We can carve out microservices (Spring Boot) from their legacy monolith, enabling their internal team to focus on "Future Products" while we handle the re-platforming.
