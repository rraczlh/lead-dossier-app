### 1. DATA VALIDATION (Excel vs. Current 2026)

| Data Point | Excel Value | Current (Jan 2026) | Verification Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | £300M | **$1.9B (Gross Sales)** | [Travel Weekly Power List 2024/2025](https://www.travelweekly.com) |
| **Key Decision Maker** | CIO | **Miljenko Cvijanovic (CTO)** | [BTN Europe / ATPI Leadership](https://www.businesstravelnewseurope.com) |

> **Analyst Note:** The £300M figure likely refers to *Net Revenue* (fees), whereas the $1.9B figure represents *Gross Sales* (Total Transaction Value). The acquisition by Direct Travel creates a combined entity with significantly higher tech needs.

### 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX (High-Signal Items 2025-2026)

**[M&A Event]: Acquisition by Direct Travel**
*   **The Evidence:** ATPI has been acquired by Direct Travel to form a "global travel management powerhouse." This triggers immediate need for system consolidation, data migration, and platform unification between Direct Travel's stack and ATPI's legacy systems.
*   **The Source:** [ATPI Official Announcement / Website Snippet](https://www.atpi.com)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Cloud Modernization (Azure) & Data Engineering (Post-Merger Integration).

**[Product Launch]: ATPI Halo & Scope 3 Reporting**
*   **The Evidence:** ATPI expanded "ATPI Halo" (Sustainability) to include "Well-to-Tank" emissions calculations and new reporting dashboards in late 2025. This requires advanced data modeling (Python/Pandas) to handle complex CO2e datasets across maritime and corporate travel.
*   **The Source:** [ATPI Sustainability Report 2025](https://www.atpi.com)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Data Science (Python/Pandas) & Dashboarding (Power BI/React).

**[Mobile Engineering]: "ATPI On The Go" v8.4 Updates**
*   **The Evidence:** Frequent updates to the "ATPI On The Go" mobile app (v8.4.1 released Dec 2025) to support new languages (Portuguese, Swedish) and "Location based SOS" features. The app is developed by TripStax (ATPI's spin-out), indicating a reliance on external/partner engineering resources.
*   **The Source:** [Apple App Store Version History](https://apps.apple.com)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Mobile Development (React Native/Swift).

**[Infrastructure]: TripStax "The Core" Ecosystem**
*   **The Evidence:** ATPI relies on the "TripStax" tech stack, which was spun out as a separate entity. ATPI now consumes this via APIs. The architecture is built on Microsoft Azure, requiring constant API integration work to connect "The Core" with client-specific ERPs (SAP, Oracle).
*   **The Source:** [TripStax Technology Overview](https://www.tripstax.com)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Backend Development (.NET/Azure Functions) for API Integrations.

### 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Azure:** The backbone of their infrastructure (via TripStax relationship).
*   **C# / .NET:** The primary language for their booking engines and backend services.
*   **React Native:** Used for the "ATPI On The Go" cross-platform mobile application.
*   **SQL Server:** Core database for traveler profiles and transaction data.

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **Power BI -> Custom Dashboards:** They use Power BI for client reporting; opportunity to upgrade to custom **React/Next.js** analytics portals for their "Direct ATPI" enterprise clients.
*   **Legacy GDS -> NDC APIs:** Moving from cryptic Amadeus/Sabre commands to **RESTful/JSON** APIs (NDC standards), which aligns with our API development capabilities.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **GDS Scripting:** We do not support legacy GDS cryptic screen scraping or mainframe maintenance (Amadeus/Sabre native coding).

### 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The Post-Merger Data Headache**
*   **The Trigger:** The recent acquisition by Direct Travel.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Merging two massive TMCs creates a "data swamp" of duplicate traveler profiles and disconnected booking history (Direct Travel's systems vs. ATPI's Azure stack).
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Miljenko, post-acquisition integration usually stalls at the data layer. We can deploy a **Python/Data Engineering pod** to automate the reconciliation of Direct Travel and ATPI user profiles, ensuring your new combined reporting is accurate by Q3."

**Conversation Starter 2: Decoupling from TripStax**
*   **The Trigger:** The reliance on TripStax (spun-out entity) for core tech.
*   **The Logical Friction:** While TripStax provides the engine, ATPI needs its own "secret sauce" layers on top to differentiate from competitors who might also use TripStax.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Now that TripStax is a separate vendor, you likely need a 'Client Innovation Layer' that sits on top of their APIs. Our **.NET & React teams** can build custom client portals that consume TripStax data but give you full control over the UX and feature roadmap."

**Conversation Starter 3: Sustainability as a Data Product**
*   **The Trigger:** The expansion of ATPI Halo and "Well-to-Tank" reporting.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Corporate clients (especially in Energy/Marine) are demanding real-time, audit-grade CO2 data, not just static PDF reports. Excel/Power BI often breaks under this complexity.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "We can help upgrade ATPI Halo from a reporting tool to a **predictive analytics platform**. Using **Azure AI & Python**, we can help you forecast carbon budgets for your energy clients before they book, rather than just reporting on it after the fact."
