2. THE EVIDENCE BOX (High-Signal Items)
| Type | Signal Title | The Evidence | The Source | Mapping-2-Localhost Service |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **App Dev** | **Custom .NET Quotation Manager** | LWC commissioned a bespoke "Quotation Manager" web application built on **Microsoft SQL Server** and **.NET** to replace legacy Excel processes for 10+ depots. | [Magnifica Case Study: Quotation Manager](https://magnifica.co.uk/work/lwc-drinks-quotation-manager) | **.NET Core Modernization** |
| **Hiring** | **Mobile App Development** | Active recruitment for "Mobile App Developer" roles indicates in-house development of their customer-facing ordering platform (iOS/Android). | [TotalJobs / Reed Hiring Data](https://www.totaljobs.com/jobs/at/lwc-drinks) | **Mobile Development (React Native/Flutter)** |
| **Ops Tech** | **WMS Upgrade Initiative** | Official company statements confirm they "recently upgraded our warehouse management systems (WMS)" to support their new "Super Hub" in Chadderton. | [LWC Drinks: About Us (Innovation Section)](https://www.lwc-drinks.co.uk/about-us/) | **Cloud DevOps / Infrastructure** |
| **Data** | **BI & Analytics Stack** | Evidence of "Data Analyst" roles (e.g., Simon Bowyer) using **Diver BI** (Dimensional Insight) for sales and depot reporting. | [Diver BI Case Study: LWC Drinks](https://www.diverbi.com/customers/) | **Data Science & ML (Migration to PowerBI/Snowflake)** |

3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION
**Comparison of LWC Drinks Stack vs. Localhost Matrix**

✅ **The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Backend:** .NET / C# (Core part of their custom app stack).
*   **Database:** Microsoft SQL Server (Confirmed backend for Quotation Manager).
*   **Mobile:** Mobile App Development (Active hiring for ordering platform).

⚠️ **The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **BI/Data:** They use **Diver BI** (Niche). *Opportunity:* Migrate to **Power BI** or **Snowflake** for better scalability and AI integration (Localhost capability).
*   **WMS Integration:** They use a proprietary/industry WMS. *Opportunity:* Build custom API middleware using **Azure Functions** or **Node.js** to link WMS to the .NET Quotation App.
*   **Web:** They rely on **WordPress** for marketing. *Opportunity:* Headless CMS migration to **Next.js/React** for better e-commerce performance.

❌ **The Mismatch:**
*   **Salesforce:** While "LWC" (Lightning Web Components) appears in searches, it is a false positive acronym match. LWC Drinks uses Microsoft-centric custom apps, not Salesforce core dev (unless for basic CRM).

4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The .NET Modernization Play**
*   **The Trigger:** Their "Quotation Manager" is a bespoke .NET/SQL application critical to sales.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Custom .NET apps built 3-4 years ago often suffer from "framework rot" (stuck on older .NET Framework vs. .NET Core) and lack cloud-native scalability (Azure PaaS).
*   **The Partnership Angle:** *"We see you've built a custom Quotation Manager on .NET. Localhost's .NET modernization pods can refactor this into a cloud-native Azure app, reducing maintenance costs and enabling AI-driven pricing suggestions."*

**Conversation Starter 2: The "Super Hub" Logistics Integration**
*   **The Trigger:** The recent opening of the Chadderton "Super Hub" and WMS upgrade.
*   **The Logical Friction:** New WMS implementations rarely talk perfectly to existing ERPs or custom sales apps (like the Quotation Manager), creating data silos and manual entry for depot staff.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** *"With the new Super Hub online, are your WMS and Order Ordering apps fully synchronized? We specialize in building high-throughput API middleware (Node.js/Go) to ensure your inventory data is real-time across all 10 depots."*

**Conversation Starter 3: Mobile Ordering Experience**
*   **The Trigger:** Active hiring for Mobile App Developers for the customer ordering portal.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Hiring individual mobile devs is slow and creates "key person dependency." Scaling a B2B ordering app requires a full team (QA, UI/UX, Backend) to compete with major e-commerce players.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** *"Instead of struggling to hire individual mobile devs, Localhost can deploy a managed Mobile Squad (React Native/Flutter) to accelerate your Online Ordering App roadmap, ensuring you capture more digital orders in Q3."*
