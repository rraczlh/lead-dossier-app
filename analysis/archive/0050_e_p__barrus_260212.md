1. DATA VALIDATION (Excel vs. Current 2026)

| Data Point | Excel Value | Current (Jan 2026) | Verification Source (Title/Link) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | 60000000.0 | **£31.9M GBP** (~$40M USD) | [FY24 Financial Results (Continuing Ops)](https://www.barrus.co.uk) |
| **Key Decision Maker** | [Name] | **Graham Knox** (CEO) | [Appointed Sep 2023 - Barrus News](https://www.barrus.co.uk/news) |
| **Status** | Hold | **Target - Niche Engineering** | Hiring for Hybrid/Electric R&D |

> **Analyst Note:** The revenue drop is due to the strategic sale of their "Precision Machined Components" (PMC) division in Oct 2024. This is a *positive* signal: they have shed a manufacturing heavy-asset division to focus on distribution and high-tech marine propulsion, likely leaving them with significant capital (~£6.2M cash) for reinvestment in R&D and Digital.

| **Hiring** | **Hybrid/Electric Propulsion R&D** | Hiring "Software and Electronics Engineer" in Bicester to "Own the software control... for hybrid products." Requires **C++** and **Embedded Software**. | [Indeed / Barrus Careers (2025/26)](https://uk.indeed.com/q-Software-And-Electronics-Engineer-jobs.html) | **Application Development** (Embedded/IoT) |
| **Tech Stack** | **Data & Pricing Modernization** | Hiring "Pricing and Data Analyst" requiring skills in **Power BI**, **Infor** (ERP), and **B2WISE** (Supply Chain). | [Totaljobs / Barrus Careers](https://www.totaljobs.com) | **Data & AI** (Power BI Analytics) |
| **Digital Product** | **New B2B Portal Launch** | Launched "MYBOAT247", a new B2B marine equipment portal (Jan 2024) to replace legacy systems. Indicates a shift to digital self-service. | [Barrus News: MYBOAT247 Launch](https://www.barrus.co.uk/news) | **Application Development** (B2B Commerce) |
| **Leadership** | **Microsoft Strategic Influence** | **Neil Thompson** (Former VP at Microsoft EMEA) sits on the Board of Directors.

| **Supply Chain** | **Advanced Planning System** | Usage of **B2WISE** (DDMRP software) indicates sophistication in supply chain logic, requiring integration with their core ERP. | [Job Post: Pricing Analyst](https://www.totaljobs.com) | **Apis & Integration** (ERP Integration) |

3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

✅ **The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **C++ / Embedded C:** Critical requirement for their new "Hybrid and Electric Propulsion" division. They are building control systems for marine engines.
*   **Power BI:** actively used for pricing and sales dashboards.
*   **Microsoft Ecosystem:** Strong board-level influence (Neil Thompson) suggests a receptive environment for Azure/Dynamics services.

⚠️ **The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **Infor (System21) -> Microsoft Dynamics 365:** They currently list "Infor" and "System21" (Legacy GEAC) in job posts, but with a Microsoft VP on the board and a recent divestiture providing cash, they are a prime candidate for a "Legacy to Cloud ERP" migration (likely to Dynamics 365 Finance & Supply Chain).
*   **B2WISE:** A niche supply chain tool that likely needs custom API wrappers to talk to their new B2B portal (MYBOAT247).

❌ **The Mismatch:**
*   **Legacy IBM iSeries (AS/400):** Historical reliance on LANSA/System21 (Green screen era) which they are slowly peeling away from. We do not support AS/400 maintenance.

4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The "Propulsion R&D" Accelerator**
*   **The Trigger:** Their active recruitment for "Software and Electronics Engineers" to build hybrid/electric engine controls (C++).
*   **The Logical Friction:** Finding specialized embedded C++ talent in Bicester is difficult and slow. A single hire cannot build a scalable testing/QA framework for safety-critical marine systems.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** Localhost can deploy a **Managed Embedded Pod** (C++/Rust experts) to accelerate their hybrid engine roadmap, specifically handling the "Software Control and Management Process" mentioned in their job post, allowing their core team to focus on hardware integration.

**Conversation Starter 2: The "Post-Divestiture" Modernization**
*   **The Trigger:** The sale of the PMC division (Oct 2024) and the presence of Neil Thompson (ex-Microsoft VP) on the board.
*   **The Logical Friction:** They are likely sitting on legacy Infor System21 ERP data that is hard to surface in their new "MYBOAT247" portal or Power BI dashboards without fragile middleware.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** Propose a **Data Modernization Sprint**. We don't just build dashboards; we build the *Azure Data Factory* pipelines that suck data out of Infor/B2WISE and feed it into the Power BI models their analysts are struggling to maintain manually.

**Conversation Starter 3: The Supply Chain Intelligence Layer**
*   **The Trigger:** Their use of **B2WISE** (DDMRP) combined with a new "Pricing and Data Analyst" role.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Supply chain tools often sit in silos. The "Pricing Analyst" is likely manually exporting CSVs from Infor to feed B2WISE, creating latency in pricing decisions.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** Offer an **Integration Audit**. We can automate the flow between their B2B Portal (Demand Signal), Infor (Stock), and B2WISE (Planning) using modern APIs, ensuring their "Next Day Delivery" promise is backed by real-time data.
