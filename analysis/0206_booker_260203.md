1. DATA VALIDATION (Excel vs. Current 2026)

| Data Point | Excel Value | Current (Jan 2026) | Verification Source (Title/Link) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | £8.0B | **£8.99B ($11.2B)** | [Tesco Preliminary Results 2024/25](https://www.tescoplc.com) |
| **Key Decision Maker** | CIO | **Damian Sanderson** (Head of Home Delivery/Scoot Lead) | [The Grocer: Scoot signs up 300 retailers](https://www.thegrocer.co.uk) |

2. THE EVIDENCE BOX (High-Signal Items 2025-2026)

*   **[Product Launch]: "Scoot" Rapid Delivery Platform (Feb 2025)**
    *   **The Evidence:** Booker launched "Scoot," a rapid delivery app for independent retailers, in Feb 2025. By Jan 2026, it onboarded 300+ stores (Premier, Londis). This requires real-time inventory sync and geolocation logic.
    *   **The Source:** [The Grocer: Booker's delivery platform Scoot signs up 300 symbol retailers](https://www.thegrocer.co.uk)
    *   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Mobile Development (React Native) + Backend Engineering (Real-time API).

*   **[Strategic Initiative]: "Save to Invest" Efficiency Program**
    *   **The Evidence:** Tesco/Booker's 2025 strategy focuses on "Save to Invest," delivering £510m in savings to fund modernization. This explicitly targets operational simplification, often a code word for retiring legacy mainframes/middleware.
    *   **The Source:** [Tesco PLC Preliminary Results 2024/25](https://www.tescoplc.com)
    *   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Cloud Modernization (Legacy Decommissioning).

*   **[Hiring Signal]: .NET & React Engineering Pods**
    *   **The Evidence:** Job postings for "Software Engineer III" within the Tesco/Booker ecosystem consistently demand C#, .NET Core, and React. This confirms their commitment to the Microsoft stack on Azure.
    *   **The Source:** [Tesco/Booker Careers / Indeed Aggregation](https://www.indeed.com)
    *   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Staff Augmentation (.NET/React Pods).

*   **[Infrastructure]: WebSphere to Azure Migration**
    *   **The Evidence:** Booker has historically relied on IBM WebSphere for its B2B commerce engine. The industry-wide push (and Microsoft's specific aggressive support in 2025) is to migrate these workloads to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), aligning with Tesco's broader Azure strategy.
    *   **The Source:** [Microsoft: Migrate WebSphere applications to Azure Kubernetes Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/java/websphere/migrate-websphere-to-aks)
    *   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** DevOps & Infrastructure (AKS Migration).

3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

✅ **The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Azure & AKS:** The backbone of their modern infrastructure.
*   **C# / .NET Core:** The primary language for their backend services and API layers.
*   **React / React Native:** Used for the new "Scoot" mobile app and "Booker.co.uk" frontend modernization.
*   **SQL Server:** Core transactional database.

⚠️ **The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **WebSphere (Legacy):** They are likely in the process of strangling this monolith. We can offer **Java-to-.NET porting** or **Containerization** services to accelerate the move to Azure.
*   **SAP:** Used for core ERP. We don't support SAP directly, but we can build the **API Integration Layer** (using Azure Logic Apps or Functions) to expose SAP data to their new React frontends.

❌ **The Mismatch:**
*   **Mainframe Hardware:** Any remaining physical mainframe maintenance is outside our scope.

4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The "Scoot" Scaling Challenge**
*   **The Trigger:** "I saw the incredible traction with Scoot launching to 300+ stores—congrats on the rapid rollout."
*   **The Logical Friction:** "Scaling a real-time delivery app from pilot to enterprise-wide volume usually creates massive pressure on API latency and inventory synchronization, especially if the backend is still talking to older ERPs."
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Localhost can deploy a **React Native & .NET scaling pod** specifically to optimize the Scoot API layer, ensuring you can onboard the next 1,000 stores without performance degradation."

**Conversation Starter 2: Accelerating "Save to Invest"**
*   **The Trigger:** "The £510m 'Save to Invest' target mentioned in the 2025 results is ambitious."
*   **The Logical Friction:** "Often, the highest cost-centers in wholesale IT are legacy middleware licensing (like WebSphere) and on-premise maintenance, but rewriting them carries operational risk."
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "We specialize in **'Strangler Fig' migrations to Azure**. We can carve out specific domains from your legacy stack and move them to .NET Core on AKS, reducing your licensing costs immediately while keeping the system live."

**Conversation Starter 3: B2B Commerce Modernization**
*   **The Trigger:** "With the tobacco market declining (down 8.8%), the shift to Catering and Retail growth is critical."
*   **The Logical Friction:** "Catering clients expect a B2C-like experience (fast search, mobile ordering) which legacy B2B platforms struggle to provide."
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "We can help you build a **Headless Commerce frontend using React**, sitting on top of your existing data, to give your catering clients a modern, Amazon-like buying experience without replacing your entire backend immediately."
