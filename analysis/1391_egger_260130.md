### 1. DATA VALIDATION (Excel vs. Current 2026)

| Data Point | Excel Value | Current (Jan 2026) | Verification Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | €4.0B | **€4.13 Billion** (~$4.46B USD) | [EGGER Annual Report 2023/24](https://www.egger.com/en/company/news/financial-year-2023-2024?country=IE) |
| **Key Decision Maker** | CIO | **Hannes Mitterweissacher** (CTO) | [EGGER Group Management Structure](https://www.egger.com/en/company/about-us/management?country=IE) |
| **Status** | Active | **Confirmed** (Group Mgmt) | Verified via Corporate Site |

> **Analyst Note:** While Hannes Mitterweissacher is the CTO (Chief Technology Officer), his role encompasses the "Digital Factory" and production technology convergence. For pure IT infrastructure, the "Head of Corporate IT" (historically Guenter Leitner) reports up to this board level. The strategic pitch should target the CTO's "Digital Factory" initiatives.

### 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX (High-Signal Breadcrumbs)

**Type: Infrastructure Investment**
**Signal Title:** €200M Investment in Markt Bibart Plant (Automation & Digitalization)
**The Evidence:** EGGER is investing heavily (€200M+) in their Markt Bibart site (Germany) through 2026. The explicit focus is on "automation, logistics, and sustainability," which requires heavy IoT integration, edge computing (Azure), and data pipeline engineering.
**The Source:** [EGGER Press Release - Markt Bibart Investment](https://www.egger.com/en/company/news/investment-markt-bibart?country=IE)
**Mapping-2-Localhost:** `Azure` `IoT` `Data Engineering`

**Type: Cloud Strategy**
**Signal Title:** Strategic Shift to "SAP on Azure" & Microsoft Fabric
**The Evidence:** EGGER is a known heavy user of SAP S/4HANA. Recent industry patterns and their "Digital Factory" initiatives in Lexington, NC, point to a "Cloud First" strategy using Microsoft Azure for data lakes. The integration of SAP data into **Microsoft Fabric** (for sustainability reporting) is a critical active workstream for manufacturing leaders in DACH.

**Mapping-2-Localhost:** `Microsoft Fabric` `Power BI` `Azure Data Factory`

**Type: Hiring / Skills**
**Signal Title:** Demand for "IT System Engineer" and "SAP Inhouse Consultants"
**The Evidence:** Recent job postings (late 2025) for their St. Johann HQ and Lexington, NC locations list requirements for **C#**, **.NET**, and **SQL Server** for internal shop-floor application development that bridges the gap between SAP and production machinery.

### 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Microsoft Azure:** The backbone of their "Digital Factory" and global connectivity.
*   **C# / .NET Core:** The primary language for their custom internal applications (logistics, production tracking) that sit outside SAP.
*   **Power BI / Microsoft Fabric:** Essential for their "Net Zero 2050" sustainability reporting dashboards.
*   **SQL Server:** The operational database for plant-level data storage.

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **SAP Integration (BTP):** They rely heavily on SAP S/4HANA. We don't support ABAP, but we *do* support the **Java/Node.js** microservices often required to connect SAP BTP (Business Technology Platform) to Azure. This is a massive "glue code" opportunity.
*   **Python (Data Science):** As they ramp up "Digital Twin" models for wood recycling efficiency, they will move from Excel/SQL to Python/Pandas for predictive maintenance models.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **ABAP:** We cannot support their core SAP ERP customization.
*   **Operational Technology (OT):** Proprietary PLC programming (Siemens/Beckhoff) is out of scope for us.

### 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The "Data Silo" Friction**
*   **The Trigger:** The €200M Markt Bibart automation expansion.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Rapidly expanding plant automation creates massive data silos where machine data (OT) doesn't talk cleanly to the ERP (IT/SAP). Internal teams often struggle to build the "middleware" fast enough in C#/.NET while handling legacy operations.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Hannes, with the Markt Bibart expansion, are your internal .NET teams fully capacity-blocked by keeping the lights on? Localhost can deploy a 'Modernization Squad' to handle the Azure-to-SAP connectivity layer, ensuring your new automation data flows into S/4HANA on day one."

**Conversation Starter 2: The Sustainability Reporting Gap**
*   **The Trigger:** EGGER's "Net Zero 2050" commitment and EcoVadis Gold rating.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Achieving these ratings requires auditable, real-time data across 22 global plants. Most manufacturers are stuck manually aggregating Excel sheets from different sites, which is error-prone and slow.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "We see you're pushing hard on the Net Zero 2050 goals. We specialize in building automated **Microsoft Fabric** data pipelines that pull raw energy/waste data directly from plant SQL servers into Power BI dashboards, eliminating the manual reporting grind for your sustainability team."

**Conversation Starter 3: The SAP-Azure "Glue"**
*   **The Trigger:** The convergence of SAP S/4HANA and Azure Cloud.
*   **The Logical Friction:** SAP developers (ABAP) don't speak Cloud (Azure/Bicep), and Cloud Architects don't understand SAP data structures. This creates a "skill gap" where cloud migrations stall because the integration layer is fragile.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Most manufacturing CIOs we speak with are struggling to get SAP BTP to play nicely with Azure native services. Since we specialize in the **C# and Cloud DevOps** side of that equation, we can act as the 'accelerator' for your SAP team, building the APIs and infrastructure they need to consume cloud services without them needing to retrain."
