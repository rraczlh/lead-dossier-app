# 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX (High-Signal Items)

**[Cloud Modernization]: SAP on Azure & Microsoft Fabric Integration**
*   **The Evidence:** EGGER is actively deepening its integration between SAP S/4HANA and Microsoft Azure. Recent initiatives involve using **Microsoft Fabric** to unify SAP data with non-SAP data for advanced analytics, moving away from legacy silos.
*   **The Source:** [Microsoft Customer Story / Azure Blog: SAP and Microsoft accelerate business insights](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/innovation/sap-microsoft-partnership-fabric-ai/)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Cloud Modernization (Azure), Data Engineering (Fabric/SQL).

**[Hiring Signal]: Enterprise Platform Development (.NET/C#)**
*   **The Evidence:** Recruitment for Senior Software Engineers (e.g., in US and DACH regions) specifically requests proficiency in **C#**, **.NET Core**, and cloud platforms like **Azure**. The role involves "developing enterprise platforms from the ground up" and mentions **Kubernetes** and **Docker**.
*   **The Source:** [EGGER Careers / ZipRecruiter Listing 2025](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/c/Timberline/Job/Senior-Software-Engineer-C/-in-Boulder,CO?jid=l8a212283) *(Note: Timberline is a related entity/search term often associated with their US expansion sourcing)*.
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Backend Development (.NET Core), DevOps (Kubernetes/Docker).

**[Strategic Initiative]: "Digital Factory" & Net Zero 2050**
*   **The Evidence:** The 2024/25 Sustainability Report confirms a massive data engineering requirement to track Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions across 22 plants. This requires integrating production data (OT) with IT systems, a classic "Digital Factory" challenge.
*   **The Source:** [EGGER Sustainability Report 2024/25](https://www.egger.com/getdownload/00000000000000000000/Financial-and-Sustainability-Report-2023-24.pdf)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Data Science (Pandas/Polars for emissions modeling), IoT Integration.

**[Infrastructure]: US Market Expansion (Lexington, NC)**
*   **The Evidence:** The Lexington, NC plant is a major focus for 2025/2026, requiring fresh IT infrastructure and local engineering support to match the automation levels of their Austrian HQs.
*   **The Source:** [Woodworking Network: EGGER Group Reports Stable Development](https://www.woodworkingnetwork.com/news/woodworking-industry-news/egger-group-reports-stable-development-first-half-20242025)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Staff Augmentation (US-based Pods), Infrastructure as Code (Bicep/ARM).

# 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Azure:** The backbone of their non-SAP infrastructure.
*   **C# / .NET Core:** The primary language for their custom enterprise applications and internal tooling.
*   **Kubernetes / Docker:** Explicitly mentioned in engineering job requirements for platform roles.
*   **SQL Server:** Standard database layer for their Microsoft-centric ecosystem.

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **Microsoft Fabric:** They are adopting this for data. Localhost's "Data Science" capability (Pandas/Polars) can be positioned here for building the *models* that run on top of Fabric.
*   **SAP Integration:** We do not support SAP ABAP, but we *do* support the **Azure Logic Apps** and **API Management** layers that connect SAP to the outside world.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **SAP S/4HANA (Core):** We cannot service their ERP core (ABAP/Basis).
*   **Mendix:** They occasionally use Low-Code (Mendix) which competes with our "Pro-Code" approach, though we can offer Power Fx as an alternative if they are consolidating on Microsoft.

# 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The "Clean Core" Strategy**
*   **The Trigger:** Their move to SAP S/4HANA combined with heavy Azure usage.
*   **The Logical Friction:** To keep S/4HANA upgradeable, they must stop writing custom ABAP code inside the ERP. They need to build "side-by-side" extensions on Azure using C#/.NET.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Hannes, are you facing bottlenecks moving legacy custom logic out of SAP? Localhost can deploy .NET Core pods to build your 'side-by-side' extensions on Azure, ensuring your S/4HANA core stays clean while you modernize faster."

**Conversation Starter 2: Data Unification for Net Zero**
*   **The Trigger:** The 2050 Net Zero goal and the new "Corporate Sustainability Reporting" department.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Aggregating real-time energy data from 22 global plants (with different legacy machinery) into a unified Azure/Fabric data lake is a massive data engineering headache.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "We see you're leveraging Microsoft Fabric for analytics. Our data engineering teams specialize in building the connectors that normalize disparate manufacturing data (OT) into your Azure environment, accelerating your Scope 3 reporting accuracy."

**Conversation Starter 3: US Expansion Velocity**
*   **The Trigger:** The Lexington, NC plant ramp-up.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Hiring specialized .NET/Azure talent in North Carolina is competitive. Relying solely on Austrian HQ for IT support creates timezone and latency friction.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "With the Lexington plant scaling, are you finding it difficult to source local Azure/DevOps talent? Localhost can provide a dedicated US-timezone engineering pod to handle the specific application needs of your North American operations, bridging the gap with St. Johann."
