# 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX (High-Signal Items)

**[Strategy]: Digital Factory & Industry 4.0**
*   **The Evidence:** Egger is actively deploying "Digital Factory" initiatives to track production data across 22 global plants. This involves integrating machine data with business logic.
*   **The Source:** [Egger Sustainability & Digitalization Strategy](https://www.egger.com/en/sustainability)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** `Data Science/ML` (Predictive Maintenance), `Cloud DevOps` (Azure IoT).

**[Hiring]: Data Engineering Squads**
*   **The Evidence:** Active recruitment for "Data Engineer (m/f/d)" requiring **Python**, **Machine Learning**, and **NoSQL (Cassandra)** skills. This is a direct signal for building custom data pipelines outside of standard SAP.
*   **The Source:** [Egger Careers / JobTensor Archive](https://jobtensor.com/company/egger-group)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** `Python`, `Pandas`, `Scikit-learn`, `Databases`.

**[Infrastructure]: SAP BTP on Azure**
*   **The Evidence:** Egger utilizes **SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP)** running on **Microsoft Azure** to extend their core ERP. This architecture requires "side-by-side" extensions built in Java or Node.js rather than ABAP.
*   **The Source:** [SAP BTP Customer Success / Azure Integration](https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/customer-stories.html)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** `Java`, `Azure`, `Application Development`.

**[Product]: "TrendCast" & "myEGGER" Portals**
*   **The Evidence:** Development of customer-facing digital services like "TrendCast" (visualizer) and the "myEGGER" portal. These are web-based applications requiring modern frontend frameworks (Angular/React) and cloud hosting.
*   **The Source:** [Egger Digital Services](https://www.egger.com/en/service/digital-services)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** `Frontend (Angular/React)`, `Backend (Node.js/.NET)`.

**[Sustainability]: Net Zero 2050 Data Tracking**
*   **The Evidence:** Commitment to Net Zero by 2050 requires massive Scope 1, 2, and 3 data tracking. This necessitates a "Green Data" architecture to audit carbon footprints across the supply chain.
*   **The Source:** [Egger Sustainability Report](https://www.egger.com/en/sustainability/environment/climate-protection)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** `Data Science`, `Generative AI` (for report synthesis).

# 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Cloud:** **Microsoft Azure** (Confirmed host for "Furniture Planner" and SAP BTP extensions).
*   **Languages:** **Python** (Data Engineering), **Java** (SAP BTP Standard), **SQL** (Backend data).
*   **Frontend:** **Angular** (Commonly paired with SAP BTP/Enterprise apps).
*   **Data:** **Cassandra**, **SQL Server**.

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **SAP BTP Extensions:** They use SAP BTP. We don't implement SAP, but we *do* build the **Java/Node.js microservices** that run *on top* of BTP to keep their core clean.
*   **BIM/AR:** They use Building Information Modeling (BIM) data. We can offer **React/Three.js** developers to build better web viewers for this data.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **SAP ABAP:** We do not support legacy SAP proprietary coding.
*   **Industrial Automation (PLC):** We do not touch the physical machine layer (Siemens/Beckhoff), only the data extraction layer.

# 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Starter 1: The "Clean Core" Extension Play**
*   **The Trigger:** Their use of **SAP BTP on Azure**.
*   **The Friction:** Engineering teams often struggle to hire enough *cloud-native* Java/Node.js developers to build extensions fast enough, leading to a backlog of business requests or "dirty" hacks directly in SAP.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "We can deploy a 'BTP Extension Squad' of Senior Java & Azure engineers. We build the side-by-side apps that keep your S/4HANA core clean, accelerating your migration timeline without adding headcount."

**Starter 2: The "Green Data" Pipeline**
*   **The Trigger:** The **Net Zero 2050** commitment and "Data Engineer" hiring for Python.
*   **The Friction:** Sustainability reporting is becoming a "Big Data" problem. Manually aggregating Excel sheets from 22 plants is unscalable and error-prone.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Your Data Engineering roles suggest you're automating sustainability tracking. Our Python/Pandas experts can build the automated pipelines (ETL) to ingest plant data directly into Azure, giving you real-time CO2 dashboards."

**Starter 3: Digital Customer Experience (CX)**
*   **The Trigger:** The **TrendCast** and **myEGGER** digital tools.
*   **The Friction:** Manufacturing companies often have great backend data but clunky, "enterprise-looking" frontends that frustrate customers.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "We see you're investing in digital services like TrendCast. Our React/Next.js specialists can modernize these interfaces to consumer-grade standards, ensuring your digital tools match the premium quality of your wood products."
