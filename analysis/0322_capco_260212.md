### 1. DATA VALIDATION (Excel vs. Current 2026)

| Data Point | Excel Value | Current (Jan 2026) | Verification Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | 1000000000.0 | **~$1B USD** (Wipro Sub.) | [Wipro Financial Reports 2024-25](https://www.wipro.com) |
| **Key Decision Maker** | [Name] | **Anne-Marie Rowland** (CEO) | [Capco Press Release (April 2024)](https://www.capco.com) |

### 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX (High-Signal Items 2025-2026)

**[Partnership]: OpenAI Beta Services Partner**
*   **The Evidence:** In November 2025, Capco officially joined OpenAI’s Beta Services Partner Program to deploy "Agentic AI" solutions for banking clients.
*   **The Source:** [Capco Newsroom: OpenAI and Capco announce services partnership (Nov 17, 2025)](https://www.capco.com)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Generative AI (OpenAI, LangChain)

**[Hiring Surge]: Contract Workforce Expansion**
*   **The Evidence:** Capco is actively hiring "Technical Recruiter - Contract Hiring" roles in key hubs (Charlotte, DC, London) as of late 2025/early 2026. This indicates a specific need to rapidly scale their *contingent* engineering workforce rather than just permanent staff.
*   **The Source:** [Capco Careers: Technical Recruiter - Contract Hiring](https://www.indeed.com)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Staff Augmentation / Dedicated Engineering Pods

**[Tech Stack]: Next.js 15 & React 19 Migration**
*   **The Evidence:** Job listings for "React JS Front-end Developer" explicitly state: *"At Capco, our stack includes Next.js 15 and therefore React.js 19."* This is cutting-edge adoption requiring specialized frontend skills.
*   **The Source:** [Capco Job Application: React JS Front-end Developer](https://greenhouse.io)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Frontend Frameworks (React, Next.js)

**[Compliance]: DORA & ISO 20022 Readiness**
*   **The Evidence:** Capco is running "Deep Dive" events (Nov 2025) focused on helping banks meet EU DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act) and ISO 20022 regulations, driving demand for data engineering and integration testing.
*   **The Source:** [Arena International: AI in Financial Services Deep Dive 2025](https://arena-international.com)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Testing & QA (Automated Compliance Testing), Data Engineering

### 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Frontend:** **React.js (v19)**, **Next.js (v15)**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**.
*   **Backend:** **Java (Spring Boot)**, **Node.js**, **Python**.
*   **Cloud & DevOps:** **GCP** (Data Engineer roles), **AWS**, **Azure**, **GitHub Actions**, **GitLab CI**.
*   **AI/Data:** **OpenAI**, **Spark**, **Python (Pandas/NumPy)**.

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **NestJS:** They list NestJS for fullstack roles. Localhost supports Node.js/TypeScript, making this a low-friction adaptation for our teams.
*   **Agentic AI:** They are pivoting to "Agentic" workflows. Localhost's "Generative AI" capability can expand to support their specific agent framework needs.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **Murex / Calypso:** They have specific "Murex Credit Risk SME" roles. These are proprietary financial platforms Localhost does not support directly (though we can handle the API integrations *around* them).

### 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The "Contractor Chaos" Relief**
*   **The Trigger:** You are hiring internal "Contract Recruiters" to manage a surge in contingent labor needs (Evidence #2).
*   **The Logical Friction:** Managing individual contractors for large banking implementations creates massive administrative overhead, inconsistent code quality, and retention risks during critical delivery windows.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** Localhost functions as a **managed engineering partner**, not a staffing agency. We deploy pre-vetted **React/Next.js 15 pods** that integrate immediately, reducing your recruiter workload and guaranteeing delivery quality for your Tier-1 banking clients.

**Conversation Starter 2: The GenAI "Last Mile" Problem**
*   **The Trigger:** Your partnership with OpenAI and focus on "Agentic AI" (Evidence #1).
*   **The Logical Friction:** Financial clients demand "Agentic" workflows, but building the *scaffolding* (vector DBs, RAG pipelines, secure API gateways) consumes your high-value consultants' time on plumbing rather than strategy.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** Localhost’s **Data & AI squads** can handle the "heavy lifting" of building the **Python/LangChain infrastructure** and data pipelines, allowing Capco’s consultants to focus purely on the high-margin advisory and model tuning layers.

**Conversation Starter 3: The Modernization Gap (React 19)**
*   **The Trigger:** Your explicit requirement for Next.js 15 and React 19 (Evidence #3).
*   **The Logical Friction:** Most available "Senior React Developers" are still stuck on React 16/18 patterns. finding talent fluent in React 19's Server Components and Next.js 15's app router is a bottleneck.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** Localhost has already upskilled our frontend practice to **Next.js 15 standards**. We can inject a "Modernization Squad" to accelerate your digital banking frontend builds without the ramp-up time of individual hires.
