### 1. DATA VALIDATION (Excel vs. Current 2026)

| Data Point | Excel Value | Current (Feb 2026) | Verification Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | €102M | **€102.4M (FY23) / €10.7M (FY24)** | [Ebusco FY2024 Financial Update](https://www.ebusco.com/investors) |
| **Status** | Growth | **Distressed / Turnaround** | [Ebusco Rights Issue & Restructuring](https://www.ebusco.com/press) |
| **KDM** | CIO | **Hou Fei (COO)** | [Ebusco Management Board Update](https://www.ebusco.com/about/team) |

**Analyst Note:** Ebusco is in a critical turnaround phase. FY2024 revenue collapsed to ~€10.7M due to order cancellations and a production halt. They have pivoted to an "OED" (Original Equipment Designer) model, outsourcing assembly to China while retaining engineering IP. **Christian Schreyer (CEO) resigned in June 2025**; operations are currently led by Hou Fei (COO) and Roel Nagelmaeker (CFO).

### 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX (High-Signal Breadcrumbs 2025-2026)

**[Strategic Pivot]: The "OED" Model Shift (Design-Only)**
*   **The Evidence:** As of late 2025, Ebusco has ceased in-house assembly to focus strictly on *engineering* and *software design*, outsourcing hardware production to partners.
*   **The Source:** [Ebusco Press Release: Organizational Restructuring for OED Model](https://www.ebusco.com/press)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** This is a perfect fit for **Staff Augmentation**. They need to maintain their engineering IP (software/design) without the overhead of a massive permanent workforce.

**[Product]: "Ebusco Live" Telemetry Stack**
*   **The Evidence:** Ebusco's recurring revenue relies on "Ebusco Live," a real-time fleet monitoring platform built on Azure. It tracks battery health down to the millivolt level.
*   **The Source:** [Ebusco Live Product Page](https://www.ebusco.com/ebusco-live)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** **Azure Cloud Modernization** & **Python Data Engineering**. They need to ingest massive CAN bus data streams from third-party manufactured buses into their Azure CosmosDB/SQL backend.

**[Leadership]: Executive Void & Lean Management**
*   **The Evidence:** CEO Christian Schreyer stepped down in June 2025. The Executive Committee was dissolved to flatten the structure, leaving the COO (Hou Fei) with a massive span of control over Engineering and Sales.
*   **The Source:** [Sustainable Bus: CEO Resignation June 2025](https://www.sustainable-bus.com)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** **Managed Engineering Pods**. The COO is likely overwhelmed; a self-managed Localhost pod can take ownership of specific software modules (e.g., the Fleet Portal) without requiring heavy management oversight.

### 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Frontend:** **React** & **TypeScript** (Used for the Ebusco Live dashboard).
*   **Backend:** **C# / .NET Core** & **Node.js** (API layers for vehicle data).
*   **Cloud:** **Azure** (Static Web Apps, Functions, CosmosDB).
*   **Data:** **Python** (Telemetry analysis) & **PostgreSQL**.

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **Identity Management:** They use **Keycloak**. We can offer **Auth0/Azure AD** migration services for better integration with their Microsoft stack.
*   **IoT Ingestion:** They utilize **ViriCiti** (partner tech) and **CAN bus** raw data. Our **Python/Pandas** capability is applicable for custom analytics layers on top of this data.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **Embedded C++:** They likely have deep embedded firmware needs for the bus ECUs. We should avoid pitching low-level firmware development and stick to the *cloud/data* layer.

### 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The "OED" Asset-Light Transition**
*   **The Trigger:** Their shift to an "Original Equipment Designer" model, outsourcing manufacturing but keeping IP.
*   **The Friction:** Maintaining strict software quality control (Ebusco Live) when the hardware is being built by third parties in China creates integration risks.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Hou, with the shift to the OED model, your software becomes your primary differentiator. Localhost can deploy a dedicated **Azure/React Quality Pod** to ensure your telemetry platform integrates seamlessly with new contract-manufactured vehicles, protecting your IP without adding permanent headcount."

**Conversation Starter 2: Protecting Recurring Revenue (Ebusco Live)**
*   **The Trigger:** Financial distress makes recurring revenue (software subscriptions) critical for their survival.
*   **The Friction:** The 2024/2025 layoffs likely depleted the engineering team responsible for updating the "Ebusco Live" portal, leading to potential churn if the dashboard lags.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "We know 'Ebusco Live' is critical for your TCO value prop. We can inject **Senior .NET & Python engineers** immediately to clear your feature backlog and optimize your Azure spend, ensuring your fleet customers see value despite the operational restructuring."

**Conversation Starter 3: The Leadership Gap**
*   **The Trigger:** The departure of CEO Christian Schreyer and the dissolved Executive Committee.
*   **The Friction:** The remaining leadership (COO/CFO) is stretched thin managing a turnaround. They don't have bandwidth to manage junior devs.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Given the lean management structure post-June, you likely don't have time for hand-holding. Localhost provides **Self-Managed Senior Squads**—we take a roadmap objective (e.g., 'Integrate Battery Health Module') and deliver it autonomously, reporting directly to the COO only on milestones."
