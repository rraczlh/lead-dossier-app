## 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX
**Context:** Entrust is currently in a massive integration phase following the **Onfido acquisition** (completed April 2024) and is pivoting heavily toward **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** under the ownership of Thoma Bravo.

1.  **[Strategic Initiative]: The "Signals" Team Expansion**
    *   **The Evidence:** Entrust is actively hiring "Full Stack Software Engineers" for their **Signals Team** in London and MN. This team is building the "Identity as a Service" (IDaaS) backbone, specifically integrating Onfido's verification tech.
    *   **The Source:** [TotalJobs / Entrust Careers - Signals Team Engineer](https://www.totaljobs.com/job/full-stack-software-engineer/entrust-job)
    *   **Localhost Service Map:** **Software Engineering** (Java/Kotlin/React)

2.  **[Tech Roadmap]: Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Migration**
    *   **The Evidence:** Entrust has validated its nShield HSMs for NIST post-quantum algorithms. They are now pushing a "Crypto Agility" strategy to migrate enterprise clients to PQC standards before the "Q-Day" threat.

    *   **Localhost Service Map:** **DevOps & Cybersecurity**

3.  **[Hiring Signal]: Cloud Operations & Automation**
    *   **The Evidence:** Job postings for "Principal Cloud DevOps Engineer" indicate a need to "implement system enhancements and automation opportunities" on AWS/Azure to improve performance for their SaaS platforms.

    *   **Localhost Service Map:** **Platform Development** (PaaS Scaling)

4.  **[Product Pivot]: Deepfake Defense (GenAI)**
    *   **The Evidence:** The "2026 Identity Fraud Report" identifies Generative AI deepfakes as the #1 threat. Entrust is deploying new AI/ML models for "liveness detection" to counter this.

    *   **Localhost Service Map:** **AI & ML**

5.  **[Corporate Strategy]: Thoma Bravo Efficiency Drive**
    *   **The Evidence:** With Thoma Bravo as the owner (since 2024) and a new CEO (Tony Ball) starting March 2026, the focus is shifting to "Net Revenue Retention" and operational efficiency. This typically signals a readiness for cost-effective outsourcing.

## 3. SERVICES & STACK INTERSECTION

✅ **The Sweet Spot (Direct Service Matches):**
*   **Software Engineering:** The **Signals Team** is rewriting legacy identity stacks into modern microservices using **Kotlin, Ruby, and React**. They explicitly need "Full Stack" engineers who understand identity protocols (OAuth/OIDC).
*   **DevOps & Cybersecurity:** Their move to **Identity as a Service (IDaaS)** requires heavy infrastructure-as-code (Terraform) and containerization (Kubernetes). They are currently hiring for these exact skills to manage multi-cloud environments (AWS/Azure).

⚠️ **The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent/Upsell):**
*   **AI & ML (GenAI Defense):** While they acquired Onfido for this, the integration of Onfido's AI models into Entrust's legacy PKI infrastructure is a massive data engineering challenge. We can pitch **Data & Analytic Services** to unify the data pipelines between the two merged entities.
*   **Cloud Services (FinOps):** Owned by **Thoma Bravo** (Private Equity). PE firms are obsessed with EBITDA. Pitching a **FinOps** audit to optimize their expanding AWS/Azure spend is a high-probability entry point.

❌ **The Mismatch (Out of Scope):**
*   **Hardware Manufacturing:** Entrust manufactures physical card printers and Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). We do not do embedded hardware engineering or manufacturing supply chain.

## 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE

**Starter 1: The "Signals" Integration (Technical)**
"I noticed the Signals Team is aggressively hiring to modernize your IDaaS backbone using Kotlin and React. Integrating the Onfido tech stack into the legacy Entrust core often creates massive API friction—our engineering teams specialize in exactly this type of 'merger-driven' microservices decoupling."

**Starter 2: The Thoma Bravo/CEO Transition (Strategic)**
"With Tony Ball taking the helm next month and the Thoma Bravo focus on operational efficiency, many of our PE-backed clients are looking to decouple 'run-the-business' engineering from 'grow-the-business' innovation. We can take over the legacy maintenance of the PKI stack so your internal team can focus 100% on the GenAI defense roadmap."

**Starter 3: The PQC Compliance Trigger (Security)**
"Your recent NIST validation for nShield is impressive. However, most enterprises we speak with are struggling not with the hardware, but with the *software migration* to PQC algorithms. We have a dedicated DevOps unit that automates cryptographic agility updates, which could accelerate your client migration timelines."
