### 1. DATA VALIDATION (Excel vs. Current 2026)

| Data Point | Excel Value | Current (Jan 2026) | Verification Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | $50M | **~$150M** | [LeadIQ / Inc. 5000 Estimates](https://www.leadiq.com) |
| **Key Decision Maker** | [Unknown/Old] | **David Abendschein** (Chief Digital Officer) | [Consero Leadership Page](https://conseroglobal.com/team/) |
| **Tech Leadership** | [Unknown] | **Ellis Butterfield** (CTO - *Note: Recently linked to Sitero, verify specific Consero alignment*) or **David Abendschein** (Leads Software/AI) | [LinkedIn / Press Release](https://conseroglobal.com) |

> **Analyst Note:** David Abendschein is the high-value target. As CDO, he explicitly leads "software development and applied AI strategy," whereas traditional CTO roles here have focused on internal IT/Security (e.g., Brock Kahanyshyn, CISO).

### 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX

**TYPE: STRATEGIC PIVOT**
**Signal Title:** "AI-Native" Brand Promise & Platform Overhaul (Oct 2025)
**The Evidence:** In October 2025, Consero unveiled a new strategic vision to become an "AI-Native" finance platform at their AMPLIFY event. This includes embedding Generative AI into their proprietary SIMPL platform for "forward-looking intelligence" rather than just historical reporting.
**The Source:** [Newswire: Consero Global Unveils AI-Native Brand Promise](https://www.newswire.com)
**Mapping-2-Localhost:** `Generative AI (OpenAI/Langchain)`, `Azure AI`, `Application Development`

**TYPE: ACTIVE HIRING**
**Signal Title:** Scaling Data Engineering for Snowflake/Azure (Jan 2026)
**The Evidence:** Active job listings for "Data Engineer" require deep expertise in **Snowflake**, **Python**, and **Azure Functions**. The role focuses on building scalable data pipelines (ELT/ETL) and integrating Fivetran, indicating a move toward a modern data mesh to support their AI goals.
**The Source:** [Instahyre / Consero Careers](https://www.instahyre.com)
**Mapping-2-Localhost:** `Data Science (Python)`, `Databases (Snowflake)`, `Cloud DevOps (Azure)`

**TYPE: PRODUCT LAUNCH**
**Signal Title:** Modernized SIMPL Interface Launch (June 2025)
**The Evidence:** Consero launched a "Modernized SIMPL Interface" to improve user experience. This suggests a recent or ongoing frontend refactoring effort, likely moving away from legacy ASP.NET Web Forms to modern frameworks (React/Blazor) to support the new UI.
**The Source:** [Consero Press Release](https://conseroglobal.com)
**Mapping-2-Localhost:** `Frontend (React/Next.js)`, `Backend (.NET Core)`

**TYPE: M&A INTEGRATION**
**Signal Title:** Acquisition of BridgeView & CFO Selections
**The Evidence:** Consero is an active acquirer (backed by BV Investment Partners). Integrating the data and processes of acquired firms like BridgeView CFO Solutions requires significant backend integration work and data migration.

### 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Backend:** **C# / .NET Core** (The backbone of their SIMPL platform).
*   **Cloud:** **Azure** (Primary cloud provider, heavily utilized for App Services and Data).
*   **Data:** **Snowflake** & **Python** (Core of their new data strategy).
*   **Database:** **SQL Server** (Legacy/Operational data).
*   **DevOps:** **Azure DevOps** (Standard for their Microsoft-centric stack).

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **Frontend Modernization:** They are "modernizing" their interface. If they are moving from legacy .NET views to **React** or **Next.js**, this is a prime Staff Augmentation entry point.
*   **RPA to Python:** They use heavy automation (UiPath/Automation Anywhere is common in FaaS). Migrating fragile RPA bots to robust **Python** scripts or **Azure Functions** is a high-value pitch.
*   **Generative AI:** They have *announced* AI goals but likely lack deep in-house GenAI engineering capacity compared to traditional dev.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **ERP Implementation:** They rely heavily on **Sage Intacct** and **NetSuite**. We do not implement these ERPs, but we *do* build the custom integrations (APIs) that connect them to SIMPL.

### 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The "AI-Native" Execution Gap**
*   **The Trigger:** Their October 2025 announcement to embed GenAI into the SIMPL platform.
*   **The Friction:** Moving from a standard .NET CRUD application to an "AI-Native" system requires specialized vector database knowledge (ChromaDB/Pinecone) and LLM orchestration (LangChain) that typical .NET teams lack.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "David, saw the bold 'AI-Native' vision unveiled at AMPLIFY. Most FaaS platforms struggle to bridge the gap between Azure OpenAI prototypes and production-grade reliability. Localhost’s **Data & AI Squads** specialize in extending .NET architectures with GenAI capabilities—we can help you ship those 'forward-looking intelligence' features before Q3."

**Conversation Starter 2: The Snowflake Data Mesh**
*   **The Trigger:** Active recruitment for Data Engineers with Python/Snowflake skills.
*   **The Friction:** As Consero acquires more firms (BridgeView, etc.), ingesting disparate financial data into Snowflake becomes a bottleneck. Relying on manual ETL or rigid Fivetran connectors often leads to data quality issues that break client reporting.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Noticed the push to centralize client data into Snowflake. We’ve found that for PE-backed roll-ups, the hardest part isn't the storage, but the *ingestion pipelines*. Our **Python Data Engineering** team can build custom, resilient connectors that handle the messy data from your acquired entities better than out-of-the-box tools."

**Conversation Starter 3: De-risking the "SIMPL" Modernization**
*   **The Trigger:** The June 2025 launch of the modernized interface and reliance on external vendors (Thinkbridge).
*   **The Friction:** Heavy reliance on a single outsourced partner (Thinkbridge) for core IP creates vendor lock-in and risk. As the platform scales to $150M+ revenue, they need to diversify their engineering supply chain.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "With the SIMPL platform becoming the core of your 'Finance as a Service' delivery, diversifying your engineering partners is critical for risk management. Localhost can provide a dedicated **.NET Core & Azure pod** to work alongside your existing teams, ensuring you have redundant knowledge and faster velocity on the new interface rollout."
