## 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX
**[M&A]: Major US Expansion (July 2025)**
*   **The Evidence:** Brainlabs acquired **Exverus Media** in July 2025 to complete their "coast-to-coast" US footprint, adding significant media billings and data integration requirements.
*   **The Source:** [Adweek / PRNewswire - July 22, 2025](https://www.prnewswire.com)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Data & Analytic Services** (Merging disparate agency data silos).

**[Tech]: Proprietary "Cortex" Platform Engineering**
*   **The Evidence:** Brainlabs is actively developing "Cortex," their proprietary AI platform. Job posts for "Senior Engineer" explicitly list **Python, Django, Vue.js, and Docker on GCP** to build "tools to enhance capabilities of internal client-facing teams."
*   **The Source:** [DailyRemote / Brainlabs Careers - Oct 2025](https://dailyremote.com)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Software Engineering** (Custom App Development).

**[Strategy]: "Real Intelligence" AI Model**
*   **The Evidence:** The company has pivoted its entire value proposition to "Real Intelligence" (a hybrid of GenAI and human strategy), requiring continuous ML model training on their $1B+ media spend data.

## 3. SERVICES & STACK INTERSECTION

✅ **The Sweet Spot (Direct Service Matches):**
*   **Software Engineering:** They are hiring Python/Django engineers to build internal tools.
    *   *Why it fits:* They are not just an agency; they are a *product* company building the "Cortex" platform. They need engineering velocity to keep up with acquisitions.
    *   *Tech Validation:* Explicit use of **Python, Django, Vue.js, Docker**.
*   **Data & Analytic Services:** Handling $1B+ in media billings requires enterprise-grade warehousing.
    *   *Why it fits:* Acquisitions (Sparro, Exverus) create immediate "Data Silo" problems. They need a unified data layer (likely BigQuery/dbt) to feed Cortex.
    *   *Tech Validation:* Heavy reliance on **GCP, BigQuery, and SQL**.

⚠️ **The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent/Upsell):**
*   **Platform Development (API Economy):**
    *   *The Angle:* As they acquire more agencies, they will need a centralized API gateway to connect "Cortex" with various ad platforms (Meta, Google, TikTok) and legacy systems from acquired entities.
*   **Cloud Services (FinOps):**
    *   *The Angle:* Media agencies pass through massive cloud/media costs. Implementing FinOps on their GCP infrastructure to optimize the compute costs of their AI models is a high-value pitch.

❌ **The Mismatch (Out of Scope):**
*   **IoT & Process Automation:**
    *   *Reason:* Brainlabs is purely digital/media focused. There is no signal of hardware or industrial IoT requirements.

## 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE

**Starter 1: The "Acquisition Integration" Trigger**
"I saw the news regarding the Exverus acquisition in July—congratulations on the coast-to-coast expansion. Typically, merging agency data stacks creates a 6-12 month drag on reporting velocity. Our Data Engineering team specializes in unifying disparate GCP/BigQuery environments to accelerate that timeline."

**Starter 2: The "Cortex" Scale-Up**
"Your 'Real Intelligence' strategy relies heavily on the performance of the Cortex platform. We've noticed you're hiring Python/Django engineers to build internal tools. Localhost can provide a dedicated pod of Python seniors to clear your feature backlog, allowing your core team to focus on the AI architecture."

**Starter 3: The AI Cost Optimization**
"Running predictive models on $1B+ of media spend data usually drives up GCP costs significantly. We recently helped a similar data-led firm optimize their cloud architecture for high-throughput ML workloads, reducing infrastructure overhead by 30%."
