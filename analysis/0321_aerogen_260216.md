## 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX
**[Strategic Investment]: €300M R&D & Scaling Plan (Jan 2025)**
*   **The Evidence:** Aerogen announced a massive €300M investment to create 725 new jobs by 2035, specifically targeting R&D and product innovation in Galway and Shannon.
*   **The Source:** [ThinkBusiness.ie - Aerogen to create 725 jobs](https://www.thinkbusiness.ie/articles/aerogen-jobs-galway-shannon/)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Software Engineering** (R&D scaling)

**[Partnership]: Custom IoT Device for Synairgen (Nov 2025)**
*   **The Evidence:** Strategic partnership to develop a custom "smart" aerosol device for delivering SNG001 (inhaled interferon-beta). Requires precise dosage tracking and clinical data integration.
*   **The Source:** [Synairgen & Aerogen Strategic Partnership Announcement](https://www.synairgen.com)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **IoT & Process Automation**

**[Hiring]: Global Sales Enablement Manager (Data Stack)**
*   **The Evidence:** Job post explicitly requires experience with **Power BI**, **AWS**, and data analytics to drive commercial insights across global regions (Japan expansion).

## 3. SERVICES & STACK INTERSECTION

✅ **The Sweet Spot (Direct Service Matches):**
*   **IoT & Process Automation:** They are building custom drug delivery devices (Synairgen partnership) and expanding homecare products ("Aerogen Go").
    *   *Why it fits:* The shift from mechanical nebulizers to "Connected Health" devices requires embedded firmware, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) integration, and gateway connectivity.
    *   *Tech Validation:* Confirmed use of **Embedded Systems** and **Automation Engineering** roles.

*   **Data & Analytic Services:** Global expansion (Japan, Middle East) and the hiring of a "Global Sales Enablement Manager" utilizing **Power BI**.
    *   *Why it fits:* They have data silos between Manufacturing (Infor ERP), R&D (Clinical Trials), and Sales (CRM). They need a unified Data Warehouse.
    *   *Tech Validation:* Explicit use of **Power BI** and **SQL Server**.

⚠️ **The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent/Upsell):**
*   **DevOps & Cybersecurity:** MedTech (SaMD - Software as a Medical Device) requires rigorous ISO 13485 and IEC 62304 compliance.
    *   *The Angle:* "You are scaling R&D by 725 people. Manual compliance documentation will kill your velocity. We can implement **DevSecOps** pipelines that automate FDA/MDR compliance trails."
    *   *The Angle:* With "Aerogen Go" entering patient homes, the attack surface expands. A **Security Audit** of the mobile-to-cloud bridge is critical.

*   **Cloud Services (FinOps):**
    *   *The Angle:* They are using **AWS** and **Infor CloudSuite**. As they scale to €300M investment, cloud costs will spike. A FinOps review now prevents waste later.

❌ **The Mismatch (Out of Scope):**
*   **ERP Implementation (SAP/Oracle):**
    *   *Reason:* They are already committed to **Infor CloudSuite Industrial**. We should not pitch a replacement, but rather *integration* (API Economy).

## 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE

**Starter 1: The "Connected Health" Trigger**
"I saw the announcement regarding the Synairgen partnership and the custom device development. Typically, moving from hospital-grade hardware to 'smart' clinical devices creates massive friction in **firmware-to-cloud data integrity**. Localhost's IoT team specializes in ensuring that clinical trial data captured at the edge (the nebulizer) reaches your AWS analytics layer without loss or latency."

**Starter 2: The R&D Scaling Bottleneck**
"With the plan to add 700+ staff in Galway and Shannon, engineering onboarding and environment provisioning usually become the bottleneck. We've helped similar MedTech firms implement **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** so that your new R&D teams can spin up compliant testing environments in minutes, not weeks, keeping your 2035 roadmap on track."

**Starter 3: The Data Unification Play**
"Your expansion into Japan and the use of Power BI for global sales is impressive. However, many clients utilizing **Infor CloudSuite** struggle to merge manufacturing data with commercial sales data in real-time. We can build a lightweight middleware layer that feeds your Power BI dashboards directly from your production lines, giving you real-time visibility into global supply chain velocity."
