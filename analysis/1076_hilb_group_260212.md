# 1. DATA VALIDATION (Excel vs. Current 2026)

| Data Point | Excel Value | Current (Jan 2026) | Verification Source (Title/Link) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | $1,000,000,000 | **$904.3M** (2023) | [Insurance Business Mag: Top 20 Brokerages](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/breaking-news/revealed--the-top-20-insurance-brokerages-by-revenue-496695.aspx) |
| **Key Decision Maker** | CIO | **Bert Hardy** (CIO) | [Hilb Group Leadership Team](https://www.hilbgroup.com/about-us/leadership-team/) |

**Analyst Note:** The Excel value of $1B is highly accurate as a "Run Rate." While the last verified *audited* brokerage revenue was ~$904M (2023), the company has continued aggressive acquisitions through 2024 and 2025, almost certainly pushing them over the $1B threshold in pro-forma revenue.

# 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Salesforce:** Core CRM for their sales and producer teams.
*   **Microsoft 365 / Azure:** The "Senior Software Engineer" and "System Admin" roles imply a Microsoft-centric backend, standard for insurance.
*   **SQL & Python:** Required for the "Data Analyst" roles to process claims data and census files.

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **Vertafore AMS360 -> Data Lake:** They use industry-specific Agency Management Systems (AMS). The opportunity is **extracting** this data into a modern Data Lake (Snowflake/Azure SQL) for better BI, which aligns with their "SVP Business Analytics" leadership role.
*   **Cybersecurity Hardening:** Following their data breach settlement, they are legally and operationally bound to upgrade security. This is a prime entry point for **DevSecOps** and **Cloud Security** audits.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **Renewable Energy Engineering:** *Note:* Some job aggregators mix "Trail Ridge Power" jobs with Hilb Group. Ensure you do not pitch "Solar PV design" services; this is a data error in some public aggregators.

# 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The "Acquisition Data Factory"**
*   **The Trigger:** You acquired a North Carolina benefits business in Sept 2025 and a Florida agency in July 2025.
*   **The Friction:** Ingesting data from acquired agencies (who use different AMS systems or Excel) is likely a manual bottleneck for your IT team, slowing down the "Time to Value" of these deals.
*   **The Partnership:** Localhost can deploy a **Data Engineering Pod** specialized in "M&A Ingestion." We build automated pipelines (Python/Azure Functions) to sanitize and map acquired data into your central Salesforce/AMS instance instantly, allowing you to cross-sell immediately.

**Conversation Starter 2: Post-Settlement Security Modernization**
*   **The Trigger:** The recent focus on cybersecurity enhancements following the 2023 incident settlement.
*   **The Friction:** Compliance and remediation often distract internal teams from building new revenue-generating features.
*   **The Partnership:** Localhost's **DevSecOps** experts can act as your "Remediation Task Force," implementing the required security controls (Identity Management, Encryption, Logging) on Azure/O365 without pulling your core engineering team off their roadmap.

**Conversation Starter 3: Unlocking the "Black Box" of Claims Data**
*   **The Trigger:** Your open role for a "Benefit & Data Analyst" mentions analyzing "claims performance reports" and "census data."
*   **The Friction:** Doing this in Excel (as the job post suggests) is unscalable for a $1B company. You likely have data trapped in Vertafore/AMS360 that is hard to visualize.
*   **The Partnership:** We can help migrate your manual Excel workflows to **Power BI backed by a SQL Data Warehouse**. We automate the "Claims Performance" reporting so your analysts spend time on *insights* rather than *data entry*.
