| Data Point | Excel Value | Current (Jan 2026) | Verification Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | €400M | **€400M - €480M** | [North Data (Consolidated Report 2023/2024)](https://www.northdata.com/Nehlsen+AG,+Bremen/HRB+20365+HB) |
| **KDM** | CIO | **Stefanie Gröger** (Head of IT Dev & ERP) | [XING Profile / Corporate Structure](https://www.xing.com/pages/nehlsenag) |

## 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX
**[Role]: Head of IT Development & ERP**
*   **The Evidence:** Stefanie Gröger is identified as the key lead for "IT-Entwicklung und ERP" (IT Development and ERP). This confirms an internal mandate for custom software alongside standard ERP systems.
*   **The Source:** [XING Corporate People List](https://www.xing.com/pages/nehlsenag)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Software Engineering**

**[Product]: Nehlsen Digital Customer & Applicant Portal**
*   **The Evidence:** Nehlsen maintains a custom "Online Job Portal" and customer interface, requiring ongoing maintenance, backend integration, and frontend modernization (React/Angular).
*   **The Source:** [Nehlsen Career Portal](https://www.nehlsen.com/karriere)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Platform Development**

**[Strategic]: Green Logistics & Telematics**
*   **The Evidence:** The fleet is marketed as "Modern Vehicle Fleet" with specific driver routing and telematics requirements to meet "Green Logistics" and sustainability goals (CSRD compliance).
*   **The Source:** [Nehlsen Professional Drivers Page](https://www.nehlsen.com/karriere)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **IoT & Process Automation**

**[Compliance]: Sustainability Reporting (CSRD)**
*   **The Evidence:** As a major waste management player, Nehlsen is subject to strict EU sustainability reporting (CSRD). This requires aggregating data from waste streams, fuel consumption, and recycling rates into a unified data warehouse.
*   **The Source:** [Nehlsen Consulting / ISO Certificates](https://www.nehlsen.com)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Data & Analytic Services**

## 3. SERVICES & STACK INTERSECTION

✅ **The Sweet Spot (Direct Service Matches):**
*   **Software Engineering:** They have a dedicated "IT Development" department (Stefanie Gröger). This is a direct 1:1 match for augmenting their internal team with high-seniority engineers for legacy modernization or custom logistics apps.
*   **IoT & Process Automation:** The "Modern Vehicle Fleet" and waste sorting facilities rely on hardware-software integration. Localhost can pitch "Smart Bin" sensor integration or advanced fleet telemetry dashboards.

⚠️ **The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent/Upsell):**
*   **Data & Analytic Services:** With the pressure of **CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive)**, they likely have data silos (ERP vs. Fleet vs. HR). Pitching a "Unified Sustainability Data Lake" is a high-value strategic entry point.
*   **Cloud Services:** Moving their on-premise ERP or legacy hosting to a scalable Azure/AWS environment to support real-time route optimization algorithms.

❌ **The Mismatch (Out of Scope):**
*   **SAP Implementation:** If they are looking for a pure SAP S/4HANA migration partner, this is likely outside Localhost's core "Custom Engineering" focus, unless it involves wrapping the ERP with custom APIs.

## 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE

**Starter 1: The "IT Development" Augmentation**
"I noticed Stefanie Gröger is leading the IT Development & ERP unit. Often, teams balancing core ERP maintenance with custom innovation face resource contention. Localhost's **Software Engineering** pods can take ownership of the 'Innovation Layer' (Portals/Apps) while your internal team focuses on the ERP core."

**Starter 2: The CSRD Data Challenge**
"With the 2025/2026 CSRD reporting requirements tightening for the waste sector, many of our logistics clients struggle to aggregate real-time fuel and recycling data. Our **Data & Analytics** team builds automated pipelines that feed directly into your sustainability reports, removing the manual Excel work."

**Starter 3: Route Optimization & AI**
"Your focus on 'Green Logistics' and efficient routing is critical. We've helped logistics companies implement **AI-driven route optimization** that reduces fuel consumption by 12-15% by analyzing traffic and pickup patterns in real-time, integrating directly with your existing telematics."
