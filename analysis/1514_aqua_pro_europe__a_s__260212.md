### SECTION B: DATA VALIDATION
*   **Revenue:** €6.1 Million EUR (Verified 2024/2025).
*   **Key Decision Maker:** Management Team (Košice HQ).
*   **Status:** **Hold / Low Priority**.

### SECTION C: THE STRATEGIC EVIDENCE BOX

**Signal #1: The Logistics Reality**
*   **The Evidence:** "Market leader in drinking routine... 5 distribution centers... thousands of dispensers."
*   **The Source:** Aqua Pro Website
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **IoT & Process Automation** (Potential)
*   **The Deduction:** Their business is moving heavy water bottles. The only high-tech angle is **Route Optimization** or **IoT-enabled Dispensers** (Smart Coolers that auto-order refills).

**Signal #2: The "SaniBox" Innovation**
*   **The Evidence:** "Developed SaniBox mobile sanitation unit... unique project."
*   **The Source:** Aqua Pro History
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **N/A** (Hardware Engineering)
*   **The Deduction:** They innovate in *hardware/process*, not software. This confirms they are an industrial/logistics firm, not a digital one.

### SECTION D: TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot:**
*   *None.* This is a traditional SME.

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Long Shot):**
*   **IoT & Process Automation:**
    *   *The Angle:* "Smart Water Coolers." If they want to differentiate from competitors, adding IoT sensors to dispensers to track usage and auto-schedule deliveries would be a game-changer.
    *   *Pitch:* "Turn your dispensers into data points to optimize your 5 distribution centers."

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **Everything Else:** They do not need Cloud Native apps, Big Data, or GenAI. They need a working ERP and a website.

### SECTION E: THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE

**Starter 1: The IoT Pivot (The Only Play)**
*   "You are the market leader in Slovakia. The next step for water distribution globally is **Connected Coolers**."
*   "Imagine if your dispensers automatically alerted your distribution centers when they were 10% full, optimizing your logistics routes."
*   "Localhost's IoT team could prototype this 'Smart Dispenser' logic for you."

**Recommendation:** **HOLD.** Do not pursue unless they actively signal a desire for "Smart Logistics."
