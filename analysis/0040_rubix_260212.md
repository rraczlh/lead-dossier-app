# 1. DATA VALIDATION (Excel vs. Current 2026)

| Data Point | Excel Value | Current (Jan 2026) | Verification Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | 3000000000.0 | **€3.05 Billion** (approx. $3.25B USD) | [Rubix Annual Report / Wikipedia](https://rubix.com) |
| **Key Decision Maker** | Group CIO | **David Morkeberg** (Group CEO) | [Rubix Leadership Update Nov 2025](https://rubix.com) |
| **Tech Stack** | Headless Commerce | **SAP Commerce Cloud / Dynamics 365** | [Medienwerft Case Study](https://www.medienwerft.de) |

> **Analyst Note:** The previous KDM "Group CIO" (Antoine Thievenin) is less visible in late 2025/2026 signals. The appointment of **David Morkeberg** as Group CEO in November 2025 is the highest-signal change, often precipitating digital strategy reviews. The "Headless" signal likely refers to their "Rubix Webshops" initiative, but the core engine is confirmed as **SAP Commerce Cloud** (formerly Hybris).

# 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX

**[Strategic Shift]: CEO Transition & M&A Integration**
**The Evidence:** David Morkeberg was appointed Group CEO in November 2025. Concurrently, Rubix continues its aggressive M&A strategy, recently acquiring **ERIKS UK & Ireland** (a major industrial distributor). This creates immediate pressure to integrate ERIKS' legacy systems into Rubix's central SAP/Azure core.

**Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** `apis_and_integration` (System Integration), `data_and_ai` (Data Migration)

**[Hiring Signal]: Microsoft Dynamics & Power Platform Expansion**
**The Evidence:** "Rubix Solutions" (a division of Rubix Group) has been hiring for **Microsoft Dynamics 365 SMEs** and Developers. The roles require specific expertise in **C#, .NET, JavaScript**, and the **Power Platform** (Power BI, Power Automate) to build custom CRM workflows and integrate with third-party apps.

**Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** `application_development` (.NET Core), `tools_and_productivity` (Microsoft Power Platform)

**[Tech Stack]: SAP Commerce Cloud Optimization**
**The Evidence:** Rubix's subsidiary, **Lerbs**, successfully launched a B2B portal using **SAP Commerce Cloud** (Hybris). The project focused on "intelligent inventory management" and "automated after-sales processes," confirming their reliance on the SAP ecosystem for their digital "Rubix Webshops" initiative.

# 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Microsoft Azure:** The backbone of their "Private Cloud" and hosting for their SAP landscape.
*   **C# / .NET Core:** Essential for their Dynamics 365 customization and "Rubix Solutions" development.
*   **Power BI:** deeply embedded for reporting across their 22+ markets.
*   **JavaScript:** Used for frontend customization on their B2B portals.

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **SAP Commerce Cloud (Hybris):** We don't support SAP core dev, but we *do* support the **API Integration** (REST/GraphQL) required to decouple their frontend (Headless) from the SAP backend.
*   **M&A Data Unification:** They are acquiring companies like ERIKS. These acquisitions likely use disparate SQL/Oracle databases. We can offer **Data Engineering** pods to migrate this data into their central Azure/Power BI environment.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **SAP ABAP Development:** Core SAP ERP customization is outside our matrix.
*   **Mechanical Engineering:** "Rubix Engineering" roles often refer to physical motor repair (CNC, winding), which creates false positives in keyword searches.

# 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The "Post-Acquisition" Integration Squeeze**
*   **The Trigger:** The recent acquisition of ERIKS UK and the appointment of David Morkeberg as CEO.
*   **The Logical Friction:** "David, with the ERIKS integration, your IT team is likely drowning in data migration and ERP consolidation tasks, slowing down the rollout of new digital features for your core customers."
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Localhost can deploy **.NET/Azure Integration Squads** to handle the 'glue work'—connecting ERIKS' legacy systems to your central Dynamics 365/SAP core—allowing your internal team to focus on strategic governance."

**Conversation Starter 2: Unlocking Dynamics 365 Value**
*   **The Trigger:** Active hiring for Dynamics 365/Power Platform developers at Rubix Solutions.
*   **The Logical Friction:** "Hiring full-time Dynamics specialists is slow and expensive. Meanwhile, your sales teams need custom workflows *now* to cross-sell into the new customer bases you've acquired."
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "We have ready-to-deploy **Power Platform & C# experts** who can clear your CRM backlog in weeks, not months, automating the cross-sell workflows you need for the 2026 growth targets."

**Conversation Starter 3: Headless Agility on SAP**
*   **The Trigger:** Their move toward "Rubix Webshops" and the use of SAP Commerce Cloud.
*   **The Logical Friction:** "SAP Commerce is powerful but often rigid on the frontend. You're likely struggling to iterate your UX fast enough to compete with digital-native distributors."
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Localhost specializes in building **React/Next.js frontends** that sit on top of SAP. We can give you a 'Headless' speed advantage without ripping out your backend engine."
