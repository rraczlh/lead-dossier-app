## 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX
**[IoT & Cloud]: PERI InSite Construction (Sensor Ecosystem)**
*   **The Evidence:** PERI has deployed a massive IoT ecosystem ("InSite") using Temperature and Pressure sensors connected via **NarrowBand IoT (NB-IoT)** and **LTE-M**. They are currently using **Open Telekom Cloud** to store this data.
*   **The Source:** [PERI InSite Construction & Deutsche Telekom Partnership](https://www.peri.com/en/business-segments/digital-solutions.html)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **IoT & Process Automation**

**[Software Engineering]: 3D Construction Printing (COBOD)**
*   **The Evidence:** PERI holds a significant stake in COBOD (3D printing). They are actively developing/integrating software to translate BIM models into printer toolpaths (slicing software) for residential construction.
*   **The Source:** [PERI 3D Construction Printing](https://www.peri.com/en/business-segments/3d-construction-printing.html)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Software Engineering**

**[Data & Analytics]: Concrete Maturity Analytics**
*   **The Evidence:** The "InSite" platform performs real-time analysis of concrete strength (maturity method) to determine the exact moment formwork can be removed. This requires heavy time-series data processing.
*   **The Source:** [PERI InSite Web Application](https://www.peri.com/en/products/digital-products/insite-construction.html)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Data & Analytic Services**

**[Platform Development]: Customer Portal "myPERI"**
*   **The Evidence:** PERI maintains "myPERI," a customer portal for project management, drawing access, and material tracking. This is a classic B2B SaaS platform that requires continuous modernization.
*   **The Source:** [myPERI Customer Portal](https://www.peri.com/en/service/myperi.html)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Platform Development**

**[DevOps]: Cloud-Native Scaling**
*   **The Evidence:** Job listings and technical blogs indicate a shift towards "Digital Construction" which requires moving legacy on-premise CAD calculations to cloud-native solvers.
*   **The Source:** [PERI Career/Digital Pages](https://www.peri.com/en/career.html)

## 3. SERVICES & STACK INTERSECTION
**Comparison of PERI Stack vs. Localhost Official Services**

✅ **The Sweet Spot (Direct Service Matches):**
*   **IoT & Process Automation:** PERI is "all-in" on sensors (Pressure/Temp).
    *   *Why it fits:* They are manufacturing hardware but need robust **firmware** and **cloud ingestion layers** to handle the data flood from thousands of active construction sites.
    *   *Tech Validation:* Use of **NB-IoT** and **Open Telekom Cloud** confirms a need for specialized IoT backend engineering.
*   **Software Engineering:** Custom BIM Plugins & Calculators.
    *   *Why it fits:* They build proprietary tools like **QuickSolve** and **PERI CAD**. These require deep C#/.NET expertise and legacy modernization to move them to the web.

⚠️ **The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent/Upsell):**
*   **AI & ML:** Predictive Construction Planning.
    *   *The Angle:* They have the *data* (curing times, pressure readings) but are they using **GenAI** or **Predictive Models** to forecast project delays? We can pitch an "AI Agent" that warns site managers of curing anomalies before they happen.
*   **Cloud Services:** Multi-Cloud Strategy.
    *   *The Angle:* They are heavily tied to **Deutsche Telekom Cloud**. As they expand in the US/Asia, they will likely need a **Multi-Cloud Strategy (AWS/Azure)** for latency and compliance. We can lead that migration.

❌ **The Mismatch (Out of Scope):**
*   **Hardware Manufacturing:**
    *   *Reason:* We do not manufacture the physical sensors or the 3D printers (COBOD). We only touch the code that runs *on* them or *controls* them.

## 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE
**Conversation Starters based on Business Problems**

**Starter 1: The IoT Scalability Trigger**
"I've been following the deployment of **PERI InSite** sensors. As you scale this from pilot sites to global operations, many construction firms face data ingestion bottlenecks with **Open Telekom Cloud**. Localhost's IoT team specializes in optimizing these high-frequency data pipelines to ensure real-time latency for your concrete maturity algorithms."

**Starter 2: The 3D Printing Software Gap**
"With your investment in **COBOD**, the hardware is cutting-edge, but the bottleneck in 3D construction is often the 'slicing' software that converts BIM models to printer paths. Our Engineering team has experience building custom CAD-to-Machine interfaces that could reduce your print-prep time by 40%."

**Starter 3: The "Data Silo" Unlocking**
"You have **myPERI** for customers and **InSite** for sensors—are these data streams unified? We can help you build a **Data Lakehouse** that correlates 'rental duration' (myPERI) with 'concrete curing speed' (InSite) to automatically optimize rental billing cycles."
