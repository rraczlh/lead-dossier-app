## 4. THE EVIDENCE BOX
**[Hiring]: Data Platform Engineering**
*   **The Evidence:** Active recruitment for "UNIQA Data Platform Senior System Engineer" and "Group Data & AI Platform Engineer" focusing on Azure & Databricks.
*   **The Source:** [Profesia.sk / UNIQA Careers](https://www.profesia.sk)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Data & Analytic Services**

**[Strategy]: UNIQA 3.0 "Growing Impact"**
*   **The Evidence:** The Group's strategic roadmap through 2028 ("UNIQA 3.0") explicitly mandates "consistent digitalisation" and expansion of the "Mavie" healthcare ecosystem, driving pressure on the Slovak software hub to deliver.
*   **The Source:** [UNIQA Group Report 2024](https://www.uniqagroup.com)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Software Engineering**

**[Hiring]: Security Operations (SOC/SIEM)**
*   **The Evidence:** Urgent need for a "Senior IT Security Project Manager – SIEM/SOC," indicating an internal capability gap in advanced threat monitoring.
*   **The Source:** [Profesia.sk Job Listing](https://www.profesia.sk)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **DevOps & Cybersecurity**

**[Tech]: Observability & Tooling**
*   **The Evidence:** Specific requirements for "System Engineer - Dynatrace" and "Administrator Atlassian Jira & Confluence," signaling a mature but complex DevOps environment.

## 5. TECH STACK INTERSECTION
**Comparison of UNIQA GSC Stack vs. Localhost Official Services**

✅ **The Sweet Spot (Direct Service Matches):**
*   **Data & Analytic Services:** [Azure + Databricks]
    *   *Why it fits:* They are building a "Group Data Platform." This is not maintenance; this is new architecture. They are hiring specific "Data Platform Engineers," which maps 1:1 to our Data Engineering capabilities.
    *   *Tech Validation:* Explicit requirement for Databricks and Azure Data Factory.
*   **Software Engineering:** [Java + Spring Boot]
    *   *Why it fits:* The core insurance logic is maintained here. They have a perpetual need for Senior Java Developers to support the "UNIQA 3.0" digital initiatives.

⚠️ **The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent/Upsell):**
*   **AI & ML:** [GenAI / Predictive Models]
    *   *The Angle:* They are hiring "Group Data & **AI** Platform Engineers." While they are building the *infrastructure* (Platform), Localhost can supply the *Data Scientists* to build the actual risk/claims models on top of that Databricks infrastructure.
*   **Cloud Services:** [FinOps]
    *   *The Angle:* Heavy Azure adoption + Databricks (which is expensive) = High Cloud Bill. A FinOps audit is a logical entry point to optimize their growing cloud spend.

❌ **The Mismatch (Out of Scope):**
*   **BPO / Call Center:**
    *   *Reason:* They hire "Call Operators" and "Claims Handlers" (German speaking). This is Business Process Outsourcing, not Engineering.

## 6. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Starter 1: The "UNIQA 3.0" Accelerator**
"Tibor, I reviewed the 'UNIQA 3.0' goals regarding the digital expansion of the Mavie ecosystem. We see many insurance captives struggle to hire **Azure Data Platform** engineers fast enough to meet these 2028 targets. Localhost can deploy a dedicated Databricks pod in 4 weeks to clear your data engineering backlog."

**Starter 2: The Security Compliance Angle**
"With your active search for a **SIEM/SOC Manager**, it seems you are upgrading your threat posture. Rather than just hiring one manager, Localhost can provide a 'DevSecOps' audit to ensure your new Azure environments are compliant by design, reducing the load on your internal security team."

**Starter 3: The "Hidden" AI Bottleneck**
"You are successfully building the *infrastructure* for AI (Databricks/Azure), but are you seeing bottlenecks in actually *deploying* models? We specialize in bridging that gap—providing the ML Engineers who can take a risk model from a notebook to production on the platform your team is building."
