## 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX
**[Corporate Event]: Internal Restructuring / Asset Transfer (Jan 1, 2026)**
*   **The Evidence:** Official business register records indicate a "Sale of part of the enterprise" effective **01.01.2026** from *UNIQA Group Service Center Slovakia* to *UNIQA Insurance Group AG (Organizačná zložka)*. This signals a major shift in how IT/Service assets are governed, likely creating immediate process and data integration gaps.

*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Outsourcing Services** (Stabilization Teams) / **Cloud Services** (Migration Governance)

**[Hiring Signal]: Senior IT Security Project Manager (SIEM/SOC)**
*   **The Evidence:** Active recruitment for a Senior Security PM to manage SIEM/SOC implementations. This confirms a mature but expanding cybersecurity posture, likely driven by the "Growing Impact 2025-2028" strategy's focus on resilience.

*   **Localhost Service Map:** **DevOps & Cybersecurity**

**[Strategic Initiative]: "Growing Impact 2025-2028" Strategy**
*   **The Evidence:** The group has transitioned from "UNIQA 3.0 Seeding the Future" to "Growing Impact," with a specific focus on *Execution Excellence* and *Digitalization* of the health ecosystem. They are explicitly hiring "Group Data & AI Platform Engineers" to support this.

## 3. SERVICES & STACK INTERSECTION
Comparison of **UNIQA GSC** Stack vs. **Localhost** Official Services.

✅ **The Sweet Spot (Direct Service Matches):**
*   **Software Engineering:** High demand for **Java Developers** and Solution Architects.
    *   *Why it fits:* They are the internal software house (SWS division) for the entire Austrian group. The constant need for Java talent in Nitra/Bratislava is a known bottleneck we can alleviate with Košice-based teams.
    *   *Tech Validation:* Core stack is Java, Spring Boot, and Atlassian Suite.
*   **DevOps & Cybersecurity:** Explicit need for **SIEM/SOC** management.
    *   *Why it fits:* The hiring of a *Senior Project Manager* for Security suggests they are building or overhauling their SOC. We can offer technical implementation teams to support the PM.

⚠️ **The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent/Upsell):**
*   **Cloud Services (Azure/FinOps):**
    *   *The Angle:* The Jan 1, 2026 restructuring (transferring assets to the Austrian branch) often complicates cloud billing and tenant management. We can pitch **FinOps** to ensure the new "Organizačná zložka" doesn't bleed budget during the transition.
*   **AI & ML (GenAI for Claims):**
    *   *The Angle:* Their strategy mentions "Digitalization" and "Health Ecosystem." We can pitch **GenAI Agents** for automated claims processing or medical document parsing, moving them beyond basic "Data Platform" engineering to actual AI application.

❌ **The Mismatch (Out of Scope):**
*   **SAP Core ERP Implementation:**
    *   *Reason:* They use SAP SuccessFactors and likely SAP for core insurance ledgers. Unless it's data extraction, core SAP ERP configuration is outside our "Software Engineering" focus.

## 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE
**Starter 1: The Restructuring Trigger (High Relevance)**
"Ing. Zalabai, I noticed the legal transfer of enterprise assets to the UNIQA AG Branch effective Jan 1, 2026. Typically, these shifts create immediate 'governance vacuums' in cloud tenant management and legacy code ownership. Localhost has specialized 'Bridge Teams' that stabilize operations during such corporate carve-outs."

**Starter 2: The Security Talent Gap**
"We see you are actively looking for a Senior SIEM/SOC Manager. Finding senior security talent in Nitra is challenging. Localhost's Košice hub has a dedicated SecOps unit that can act as the 'execution arm' for your new Manager, accelerating your SOC maturity by 6-9 months."

**Starter 3: The "Growing Impact" Acceleration**
"Your 'Growing Impact 2025' strategy emphasizes execution excellence. Many insurance hubs struggle to hire Java engineers fast enough to meet these new KPIs. We operate a 'Nearshore-in-Country' model from Košice—same laws, same culture, but a fresh talent pool to scale your SWS division immediately."
