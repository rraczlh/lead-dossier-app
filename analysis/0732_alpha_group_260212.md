### 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX
*High-Signal Technical Indicators (2025-2026)*

**[Integration]: Multi-Bank Connectivity Expansion (Cobase)**
*   **The Evidence:** Following the acquisition of Cobase, Alpha has been aggressively integrating this treasury management technology into their core "Alpha Platform" throughout late 2025 to offer single-interface banking.
*   **The Source:** [Alpha Group FY24/25 Strategic Report - "Multi-bank connectivity with Cobase"](https://www.alphagroup.com/corporates/multi-bank-connectivity/)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** `APIs_and_Integration` (System Integration Pods), `Backend_Frameworks` (.NET Core/Java interoperability).

**[Platform]: "Alpha Connect" API Scaling**
*   **The Evidence:** The company is actively pushing "Alpha Connect," a RESTful API solution allowing clients to embed FX risk management and payments directly into their own ERPs. Documentation highlights specific endpoints for "Mass Payments" and "Global Accounts."
*   **The Source:** [Alpha Connect Developer Documentation](https://www.alphagroup.com/integrate-with-us/)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** `APIs_and_Integration` (REST API, OAuth 2.0), `Azure_Functions` (Serverless scaling for API hits).

**[Infrastructure]: Azure Cloud Native Strategy**
*   **The Evidence:** Technical job profiles and platform architecture descriptions confirm a heavy reliance on Microsoft Azure PaaS for their "High-tech, High-touch" alternative banking platform, specifically utilizing Azure SQL and App Services.
*   **The Source:** [LeadIQ / Alpha Group Tech Stack Report](https://leadiq.com/c/alpha-group-international-plc/5a1d3f)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** `Cloud_Platforms` (Azure, Azure OpenAI), `DevOps_and_Infra` (Terraform/Bicep for Azure).

**[Growth]: Private Markets Division Digitalization**
*   **The Evidence:** The Private Markets division (formerly Institutional) grew revenue by 20% in FY24/25. This growth is driving a need for automated "Fund Finance" workflows and "Global Accounts" provisioning, moving away from manual operations.
*   **The Source:** [LSE RNS: Full Year Results 2024](https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/ALPH/full-year-results/16384721)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** `Application_Development` (React/Next.js for Client Portals), `Data_and_AI` (Automated credit scoring models).

### 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Backend:** **C# / .NET Core** (Core banking ledger and API layer).
*   **Cloud:** **Microsoft Azure** (Primary infrastructure provider).
*   **Frontend:** **React** (Client-facing "Alpha Platform" dashboards).
*   **Integration:** **REST API** (Alpha Connect), **Salesforce** (CRM integration).

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **Cobase Legacy Stack:** The acquired Cobase platform likely runs on a different stack (potentially **Java** or legacy PHP) compared to Alpha's .NET core.
    *   *Opportunity:* **Migration/Rewriting services** to unify the codebase under .NET Core.
*   **Mobile:** Alpha has a strong web presence but limited native mobile evidence.
    *   *Opportunity:* **React Native** development for a dedicated "C-Suite Approval App" for FX trades.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **Swift (Network):** They utilize the Swift banking network heavily; while we do API integrations, deep banking protocol engineering (ISO 20022) might be outside standard "AppDev" scope unless we have specific Fintech domain experts.

### 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The "Cobase" Unification**
*   **The Trigger:** The recent integration of the Cobase treasury platform into the main Alpha ecosystem.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Merging acquired tech stacks often results in "Frankenstein" architecture—data silos, inconsistent API standards, and latency issues between the core .NET ledger and the acquired platform.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "We can deploy a **.NET Modernization Pod** to refactor the Cobase integration layer, ensuring your new multi-bank connectivity performs as seamlessly as your native Azure infrastructure."

**Conversation Starter 2: API-First Institutional Scale**
*   **The Trigger:** The 20% growth in the Private Markets (Institutional) division and the push for "Alpha Connect" API adoption.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Institutional clients demand 99.999% uptime and sub-second latency. As API traffic scales, standard monolithic Azure App Services often hit performance bottlenecks.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Our **Azure DevOps & SRE** team can audit your 'Alpha Connect' infrastructure, implementing Kubernetes (AKS) auto-scaling to handle the surge in institutional API calls without degrading performance."

**Conversation Starter 3: The "High-Touch" Digital Gap**
*   **The Trigger:** Alpha's brand promise is "High-Tech, High-Touch."
*   **The Logical Friction:** As client numbers hit 7,100+, maintaining "High-Touch" service requires better data visibility for relationship managers. They likely struggle to see real-time client health data inside Salesforce.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "We can build a **Custom Salesforce-to-Azure Data Pipeline**, giving your RMs a real-time 'Risk Dashboard' inside their CRM, powered by your core platform's data."
