| **Hiring** | Data-Driven Pricing Strategy | Hiring "Pricing and Data Analyst" to "create and maintain management dashboards using **Power BI**, Infor, or Excel" and "ensure data accuracy across ERP." | [Barrus Careers / TotalJobs](https://www.barrus.co.uk/about-barrus/careers/) | **Data Science & ML** (Data Engineering/Analytics) |
| **Leadership** | Strategic Leadership Change | **Graham Knox** appointed CEO (Jan 2024), replacing 33-year veteran Robert Muir. Knox brings "heavy trucks & industrial" efficiency focus. | [Garden Forum](https://www.gardenforum.co.uk/headlines/e-p-barrus-lines-up-new-ceo/) | **Consulting** (Digital Transformation) |
| **Tech Stack** | ERP Modernization | Job posts explicitly mention **Infor** (likely Infor M3) as the core ERP, moving away from historical legacy (LANSA/System21). | [Indeed / TotalJobs](https://www.totaljobs.com/job/pricing-analyst/e-p-barrus-ltd-job101500000) | **Databases** (SQL Server Migration) |
| **Product** | B2B Digital Channels | Operation of "Myboat247" and "Myoutdoor247" trade portals indicates a reliance on web-based B2B commerce layers. | [Barrus Dealer Services](https://www.barrus.co.uk/dealer-services/) | **Application Development** (Frontend Modernization) |

3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **SQL Server:** The backbone of their **Infor** ERP and required for the "Data Analyst" role's reporting layer.
*   **PHP:** Highly probable usage for their brand sites (Wilkinson Sword, etc.) and legacy B2B portals, which often run on Magento/Adobe Commerce in this sector.

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **Power BI -> Azure Data Factory:** They are hiring for Power BI reporting. This creates an immediate opening to pitch **Azure** infrastructure to automate the data pipelines feeding those dashboards, replacing manual Excel/CSV exports.
*   **Infor -> Cloud Modernization:** Moving from on-premise ERP (or legacy LANSA wrappers) to a modern cloud data warehouse (Snowflake/Azure SQL) to support the new CEO's efficiency goals.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **Legacy IBM i (AS/400):** Historical reliance on LANSA/System21. We do not support RPG/AS400 directly, but we can support the *exit* from it.

4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

*   **Conversation Starter 1: The "New CEO" Efficiency Play**
    *   **The Trigger:** Graham Knox's recent appointment and the specific hiring of a "Pricing and Data Analyst."
    *   **The Friction:** New CEOs in distribution often hit a "Data Wall"—they want real-time margin analysis, but the data is trapped in legacy ERPs (Infor/System21) and requires manual Excel glue.
    *   **The Partnership Angle:** "Graham's focus on operational efficiency requires clean data. Localhost can deploy a **SQL Server/Azure** data layer that automates your Power BI reporting, giving your new leadership real-time visibility without the manual Excel drudgery."

*   **Conversation Starter 2: De-risking the B2B Portals**
    *   **The Trigger:** The existence of "Myboat247" and "Myoutdoor247" portals.
    *   **The Friction:** These portals are likely aging monolithic applications (PHP/Legacy Web) that are becoming hard to maintain and insecure.
    *   **The Partnership Angle:** "Your dealer network relies on 24/7 uptime. Localhost can audit your current B2B portals and propose a modernization roadmap using **React/Next.js** to improve dealer experience and reduce maintenance costs."

*   **Conversation Starter 3: The ERP Data Liberation**
    *   **The Trigger:** The explicit mention of "Infor" and "Data Accuracy" challenges in their job posts.
    *   **The Friction:** Ensuring data consistency between a complex ERP like Infor and sales pricing models is notoriously difficult and error-prone.
    *   **The Partnership Angle:** "We see you're working to align Infor data with pricing strategies. Our Data Engineering pods specialize in building automated validation pipelines (using **Python/SQL**) that ensure your ERP data is always trusted and audit-ready."
