## 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX (2025-2026 Signals)

**[Space/Defense]: Competence Center Optics (CCO) Launch**
*   **The Evidence:** IABG opened their new "Competence Center Optics" in September 2025 to test electro-optical satellite systems for European sovereignty.
*   **The Source:** [IABG News: Opening CCO Sept 2025](https://www.iabg.de/en/news)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **IoT & Process Automation** (Hardware-in-the-loop testing integration)

**[AI & ML]: The "SafeAI Kit" Initiative**
*   **The Evidence:** IABG is actively marketing a "SafeAI Kit" to test the robustness of AI models in public sector and defense, specifically to validate against manipulation and errors (DIN SPEC 92005).
*   **The Source:** [IABG Innovation: Safeguarding AI](https://www.iabg.de/en/innovation/ai-safety)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **AI & ML** (Model Validation & Testing Frameworks)

**[Cloud/Platform]: National Secure Cloud Expansion**
*   **The Evidence:** Job postings in late 2025/early 2026 for "Full Stack Java Developers" explicitly mention developing for the "National Secure Cloud" and "PaaS" using Docker/Kubernetes.
*   **The Source:** [IABG Careers: Java Developer Cloud](https://www.iabg.de/karriere)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Platform Development** (Building PaaS for Defense)

**[Engineering]: Digital Twin for Weapon Carriers**
*   **The Evidence:** IABG is leading the "Overall System Demonstrator" for the successor to the Wiesel 1 weapon carrier, utilizing "Digital Twin" technology to reduce development time to 25 months.
*   **The Source:** [IABG Defence: Digital Twin Projects](https://www.iabg.de/en/business-fields/defence)

## 3. SERVICES & STACK INTERSECTION

✅ **The Sweet Spot (Direct Service Matches):**
*   **Platform Development:** They are building a "National Secure Cloud" (PaaS).
    *   *Why it fits:* They are hiring Java/Spring Boot engineers to build scalable APIs and microservices for this specific internal platform.
    *   *Tech Validation:* Explicit use of **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **GitLab CI/CD**.
*   **Software Engineering (Simulation):** They require high-fidelity simulation software (Digital Twins) for defense and auto clients.
    *   *Why it fits:* Their "Digital Twin" initiative for the Bundeswehr requires complex C++/Python modeling that integrates with physical sensor data.

⚠️ **The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent/Upsell):**
*   **AI & ML (GenAI & Agents):** They focus on *testing* AI (SafeAI), but likely have a gap in *generating* synthetic training data for those models.
    *   *The Angle:* "You are validating AI models for defense; we can build the **Generative AI agents** that create the adversarial synthetic data needed to stress-test those models."
*   **Data & Analytic Services:** With the new Competence Center Optics (Satellite Data), they will face a massive influx of unstructured image data.
    *   *The Angle:* Pitching an **ETL/Data Lakehouse** architecture to process optical satellite data faster than their current on-prem systems allow.

❌ **The Mismatch (Out of Scope):**
*   **Commodity Web/E-commerce:**
    *   *Reason:* IABG is a deep-tech engineering firm. They do not need standard marketing websites or e-commerce shops; their "web" needs are complex, secure enterprise dashboards.

## 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE

**Starter 1: The "Sovereign Cloud" Trigger**
"Prof. Schwarz, I noticed IABG's push for the 'National Secure Cloud' to support European sovereignty. While your team handles the infrastructure security, we've seen that the bottleneck often shifts to the **application layer scalability** on Kubernetes. Localhost specializes in optimizing microservices architectures for high-security environments—ensuring your PaaS scales as fast as the Bundeswehr's demands."

**Starter 2: The AI Trust Gap**
"With the launch of your **SafeAI Kit**, IABG is positioning itself as the 'TÜV for AI.' We see a massive opportunity to expand this by integrating **Automated Adversarial Testing Agents**. We can deploy LLM-based agents that attempt to 'break' your clients' models automatically, feeding that data directly into your SafeAI validation reports."

**Starter 3: The Digital Twin Velocity**
"Your success with the Wiesel 1 successor proves the power of Digital Twins. However, integrating real-time sensor data from the field back into the simulation (the 'Physical-to-Digital' loop) is often where latency kills efficiency. Our **IoT & Data Engineering** teams can build the real-time pipelines to stream sensor data directly into your C++ simulation models, closing the loop instantly."
