## 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX
**[Hiring]: Technical Assistant (Data & Systems)**
The Evidence: Job post explicitly requiring "Competency in Microsoft 365: Excel, Power BI, SharePoint" and "Ability to analyse data and support the formulation of action plans."
The Source: [StudySmarter / NESI Careers](https://www.studysmarter.co.uk/companies/new-england-seafood-international/jobs/)
Localhost Service Map: **Data & Analytic Services**

**[Strategic Initiative]: "Woocheen" Platform Integration**
The Evidence: NESI is now the seafood arm of **Sealaska’s Woocheen** platform, a "global ocean health" initiative. This requires massive data transparency ("Plate to Sea") and ESG reporting capabilities to the US parent company.

Localhost Service Map: **Platform Development**

**[Operational Pain]: Manual KPI Reporting**
The Evidence: Job roles for "Technical Assistant" list "Administrative duties for all KPI incident... trend analysis, board slide creation" indicating a lack of automated dashboarding for factory floor metrics.

## 3. SERVICES & STACK INTERSECTION
Comparison of **New England Seafood** Stack vs. Localhost Official Services.

✅ **The Sweet Spot (Direct Service Matches):**
*   **Data & Analytic Services**: High Need.
    *   *Why it fits:* They are hiring junior staff to manually "analyse data" and build "Power BI" reports. This indicates a maturity gap where they need enterprise-grade BI architecture rather than ad-hoc Excel/Power BI files.
    *   *Tech Validation:* Confirmed use of **Power BI** and **Microsoft 365** stack.

*   **Cloud Services (Azure)**: Direct Fit.
    *   *Why it fits:* As a Microsoft shop (Dynamics/O365) scaling under the Sealaska umbrella, they will need to migrate legacy on-premise servers (common in Chessington/Grimsby manufacturing) to Azure for better integration with the US parent.
    *   *Tech Validation:* Microsoft ecosystem lock-in.

⚠️ **The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent/Upsell):**
*   **IoT & Process Automation**: Latent Need.
    *   *The Angle:* They operate major processing facilities in Chessington and Grimsby. The "Traceability" requirement for sustainable seafood is moving toward blockchain/IoT sensors (RFID on crates). Localhost can pitch **Factory Floor Automation** to replace the manual "KPI incident reporting" mentioned in job posts.

*   **Software Engineering (Legacy Modernization)**:
    *   *The Angle:* They likely run older EDI integrations with retailers (Waitrose/Sainsbury's). Modernizing these into API-first microservices would improve supply chain agility.

❌ **The Mismatch (Out of Scope):**
*   **Mobile App Development (Consumer)**:
    *   *Reason:* NESI is a B2B/Retail supplier (Private Label). They do not have a direct-to-consumer brand requiring a mobile app.

## 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE
**Starter 1: The "Woocheen" Data Integration**
"Dan, I saw NESI is now a core pillar of Sealaska’s Woocheen platform. typically, integrating UK manufacturing data with a US-based ESG platform creates massive reporting friction. Our Data Team can automate your 'Plate to Sea' traceability directly into Power BI, removing the manual Excel work your technical teams are currently doing."

**Starter 2: The Factory Floor Bottleneck**
"I noticed your technical teams are spending time on manual 'KPI incident reporting' and trend analysis. We’ve helped other food processors use IoT and Azure to automate these quality checks in real-time, freeing your staff to focus on food safety rather than data entry."

**Starter 3: Dynamics 365 Optimization**
"With your reliance on the Microsoft stack, are you getting the full predictive value out of Dynamics 365? We can deploy AI agents to analyze your supply chain data, predicting stock shortages before they impact your retail partners like Waitrose."
