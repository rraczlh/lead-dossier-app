### 1. DATA VALIDATION (Excel vs. Current 2026)

| Data Point | Excel Value | Current (Jan 2026) | Verification Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | 30000000.0 | **€30M+ (Est.)** | [Strohm Scale-up Announcement (Feb 2024)](https://strohm.eu/news/when-does-an-energy-start-up-become-an-energy-scale-up) |
| **KDM** | CIO | **Henk de Boer (CTO)** | [Strohm Management Team](https://strohm.eu/about-us/team) |
| **Status** | Hold | **Active Prospect** | [Strohm Launches TCP Designer (Jan 2025)](https://strohm.eu/news/strohm-launches-advanced-pipe-design-tool) |

**Analyst Note:** While the Excel lists revenue at €30M, Strohm reported a "record order intake" of €140M in late 2022 and anticipated "200% revenue growth" in 2023. They also secured a €30M investment round in late 2023/early 2024. The company is in a hyper-growth phase, transitioning from pure manufacturing to digital-enabled services.

### 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX (High-Signal Items)

**[Product Launch]: TCP Designer™ (Web-Based Engineering Tool)**
*   **The Evidence:** On Jan 28, 2025, Strohm launched "TCP Designer™," a new web-based tool allowing clients to generate datasheets, perform in-place analysis, and customize pipe designs online.
*   **The Source:** [Strohm News: Strohm Launches Advanced Pipe Design Tool (Jan 2025)](https://strohm.eu/news/strohm-launches-advanced-pipe-design-tool)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** **Application Development (Frontend/Backend)**. This is a client-facing SaaS product that will require maintenance, feature expansion (e.g., AI optimization), and cloud hosting (AWS/Azure).

**[Hiring]: Control Systems Engineer (OT/IoT Integration)**
*   **The Evidence:** Strohm is actively hiring for a "Control Systems Engineer" (Oct 2025) to work on "designing and engineering" control systems for their production and installation equipment.
*   **The Source:** [Strohm Careers: Control Systems Engineer](https://strohm.eu/careers) (Cached Listing)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** **DevOps & Infra (IoT Core)**. The convergence of their physical pipe technology with "Digital Pressure Testing" (DNV qualified) requires robust OT/IT integration.

**[Service Expansion]: Field Service Group & Digital Monitoring**
*   **The Evidence:** Strohm established a "Field Service Group" to support onsite termination and installation globally. They also hold patents for "Sensing of the contents of a bore," indicating a move toward smart/monitored pipes.
*   **The Source:** [Strohm News: Field Service Group](https://strohm.eu/news)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** **Mobile App Development**. Field technicians need offline-first mobile tools to sync installation data, test results, and compliance logs back to HQ.

### 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

✅ **The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **HTML/CSS & JavaScript:** Inferred from the launch of **TCP Designer™**, which is explicitly described as a "web-based tool" with a "user-friendly interface."
*   **Control Systems (IoT):** Matches Localhost's **AWS IoT Core / Azure IoT** capabilities for industrial data ingestion.

⚠️ **The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **Cloud Platforms (Azure/AWS):** The **TCP Designer™** tool must be hosted on a scalable cloud platform. As they scale this from a "tool" to a "platform," they will need **Terraform** (IaC) and **Kubernetes** for reliability.
*   **Data & AI:** The tool currently performs "computational capabilities." There is a clear path to add **Generative AI** (e.g., "Design a pipe for these conditions") using **Python** and **OpenAI** APIs.

❌ **The Mismatch:**
*   **OrcaFlex:** A specialized marine simulation software they use. We do not support this, but we can integrate its *outputs* into their web dashboards.
*   **Manufacturing Hardware:** PLCs and physical extruders are outside our scope.

### 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: Scaling TCP Designer™**
*   **The Trigger:** The recent launch of **TCP Designer™** as a web-based tool.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Engineering tools often start as internal scripts or basic web forms but struggle to scale when clients demand complex features (e.g., real-time collaboration, version history, API access).
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Henk, congratulations on the TCP Designer launch. Localhost can deploy a **React/Node.js pod** to accelerate your roadmap—adding features like 'saved projects' or 'AI-assisted sizing'—while your core engineers focus on the underlying physics models."

**Conversation Starter 2: The "Smart Pipe" Data Pipeline**
*   **The Trigger:** The hiring of Control Systems Engineers and the DNV-qualified "Digital Pressure Testing."
*   **The Logical Friction:** Getting data from offshore installation sites (often with poor connectivity) into a central dashboard for clients is notoriously difficult and error-prone.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "We see you're expanding your Field Service Group. We can build an **Offline-First Mobile App** (React Native) that allows your technicians to capture pressure test data on-site and auto-sync to **Azure/AWS** once connectivity is restored, ensuring 100% data integrity for your DNV compliance."

**Conversation Starter 3: Digital Twin Integration**
*   **The Trigger:** Their partnership with **UNITECH Offshore** (Feb 2025) to create integrated subsea systems.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Clients don't just want a pipe; they want a digital record of the entire subsea system. Integrating Strohm's data with partner data (UNITECH) usually creates data silos.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "As you integrate with partners like UNITECH, are you facing challenges unifying that data for clients? We can architect a **Cloud-Native Data Lake** that ingests data from both Strohm pipes and partner connectors, giving your clients a single 'Digital Twin' view of their subsea infrastructure."
