## 3. SERVICES & STACK INTERSECTION
Comparison of **Uniqa** Stack vs. Localhost Official Services.

✅ **The Sweet Spot (Direct Service Matches):**
*   **Data & Analytic Services:** Uniqa is consolidating data silos (CZ/SK merger legacy) into an **Azure Databricks Lakehouse**.
    *   *Why it fits:* They are in the middle of a multi-year migration to a "Single Source of Truth."
    *   *Tech Validation:* Confirmed use of **Azure Data Factory**, **Databricks**, and **Delta Lake**.
*   **Cloud Services:** The "Cloud-to-cloud" migration initiative requires heavy lifting in **Azure** governance and scaling.
    *   *Why it fits:* They are moving critical calculation engines (Premium Calculators) to the cloud.
    *   *Tech Validation:* **Azure Service Fabric**, **Cosmos DB**, **Azure Blob Storage**.

⚠️ **The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent/Upsell):**
*   **AI & ML:** They have built the data foundation (Databricks) but are now entering the "Execution" phase of **UNIQA 3.0** which demands AI automation for claims processing.
    *   *The Angle:* "You have the Lakehouse; now let's deploy GenAI agents for the 86% of claims you aim to automate digitally."
*   **Outsourcing Services:** Uniqa has a "Captive" center (UNIQA 4WARD/Software Services) in Slovakia/Romania.
    *   *The Angle:* Captives often struggle to scale fast enough for peak project loads. Localhost (Košice) offers a "Nearshore Overflow" model that integrates culturally and geographically with their existing SK teams.

❌ **The Mismatch (Out of Scope):**
*   **Core Insurance Product Dev (Guidewire):**
    *   *Reason:* They likely use specialized Guidewire partners or internal teams for the core policy admin system. We should focus on the *surrounding* digital ecosystem (Portals, Mavie, Data), not the monolith itself.

## 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE
**Starter 1: The "Growing Impact" Accelerator**
"Mr. Gerlach, I reviewed the **UNIQA 3.0** strategy and your goal to expand the **Mavie** health ecosystem. While your internal teams handle the core insurance logic, Localhost can accelerate the **custom platform development** for your patient-facing apps, ensuring you hit the 2028 digital targets ahead of schedule."

**Starter 2: The Data Silo Solution**
"We noticed your recent success unifying the CZ/SK data landscape on **Azure Databricks**. As you look to replicate this 'Single Source of Truth' across other CEE entities, our Data Engineering teams can provide the specialized **ETL and Lakehouse** capacity to scale this architecture without diverting your core team from AI initiatives."

**Starter 3: The CEE Talent Optimization**
"With your **UNIQA 4WARD** hub in Bratislava, you already value the engineering talent in our region. Localhost (based in Košice) operates as a 'High-Performance Extension' for similar insurance clients, allowing you to scale **Java and Cloud** teams on-demand without the overhead of direct headcount expansion during the 'Growing Impact' efficiency drive."
