## 1. DATA VALIDATION (Excel vs. Current 2026)

| Data Point | Excel Value | Current (Jan 2026) | Verification Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | 3000000000.0 | **3,724,000,000** | [CellMark Financial Summary 2024](https://www.cellmark.com) |
| **Key Decision Maker** | CIO | **Håkan Enhager** (VP IT & Digital & Procurement) | [CellMark Leadership / Håkan Enhager Profile](https://www.cellmark.com/about/people/group-management/) |
| **CEO Status** | [Unknown] | **Doug Smith** (Appointed Nov 2025) | [CellMark Press Release Nov 2025](https://www.cellmark.com) |

## 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX
**[Leadership]: New CEO Appointment (Nov 2025)**
*   **The Evidence:** Doug Smith was appointed President and CEO in late 2025. He previously led the Pulp division. New leadership often triggers a review of operational efficiency and digital strategy.
*   **The Source:** [CellMark News: Doug Smith appointed new CEO](https://www.cellmark.com)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Data & Analytic Services** (Executive Dashboards/Strategy)

**[Role]: VP IT & Digital is also VP Procurement**
*   **The Evidence:** Håkan Enhager holds the dual title of "VP IT & Digital" and "VP Indirect Procurement." This is a **critical signal** for outsourcing; the same person approving the tech strategy approves the vendor contracts.
*   **The Source:** [Håkan Enhager Profile](https://hakanenhager.com)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Outsourcing Services**

**[Tech]: JD Edwards <-> Salesforce Integration**
*   **The Evidence:** CellMark relies heavily on JD Edwards (ERP) and Salesforce (CRM). They utilize middleware (MuleSoft/Kafka) and tools like "Commercient SYNC" to bridge these systems.
*   **The Source:** [Yell Technologies Case Study / Salesforce AppExchange](https://www.cellmark.com)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Platform Development** (API/Integration)

**[Hiring]: IT Manager - Americas (Connecticut)**
*   **The Evidence:** Job posting for "IT Manager" in Norwalk, CT, requiring knowledge of Cyber Security, Network technologies, and MS Operating systems. Indicates a need for regional infrastructure support.
*   **The Source:** [Indeed / CellMark Careers](https://www.cellmark.com/careers)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **DevOps & Cybersecurity**

**[Strategic]: Sustainability Reporting (EcoVadis Gold)**
*   **The Evidence:** CellMark achieved EcoVadis Gold status and adheres to GRI G4 reporting standards. This requires heavy data aggregation across global supply chains (Recycling, Pulp, Chemicals).

## 3. SERVICES & STACK INTERSECTION

✅ **The Sweet Spot (Direct Service Matches):**
*   **Software Engineering (Legacy Modernization):** CellMark runs **JD Edwards** (Oracle) as their core ERP. This is a classic "keep the lights on" vs. "modernize" battle. They need engineers who understand legacy ERP data structures but can build modern web interfaces (React/Angular) on top of it.
*   **Platform Development (API Economy):** They are actively bridging **Salesforce** and **JD Edwards** using **MuleSoft** and **Kafka**. They have a verified need for "Middleware Engineers" to ensure real-time data synchronization between trading desks and finance.

⚠️ **The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent/Upsell):**
*   **Outsourcing Services (Staff Augmentation):**
    *   *The Angle:* Håkan Enhager (CIO) also leads **Indirect Procurement**. He is financially motivated to consolidate vendors. Pitching a "Managed Team" for JDE maintenance or Salesforce dev is a direct hit on his dual KPIs (Tech Stability + Cost Control).
*   **Data & Analytic Services (BI):**
    *   *The Angle:* They use **Qlik**. With the new CEO (Doug Smith) coming from the Pulp division, he will want consolidated, cross-division real-time reporting. Pitching a "Unified Data Warehouse" (migrating Qlik logic to a cloud-native data lake) fits the 2026 modernization trend.
*   **AI & ML (Document Processing):**
    *   *The Angle:* As a global trader, they process millions of Bills of Lading, Invoices, and Customs Declarations. They mention "Digital Transformation." Pitching **GenAI for Document Automation** (OCR + LLM extraction) to reduce manual entry in JD Edwards is a high-value play.

❌ **The Mismatch (Out of Scope):**
*   **Hardware Engineering:** They are a trading house, not a manufacturer. While they have "Recycling Plants," they don't need embedded software for consumer electronics.

## 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE

**Starter 1: The "Dual-Hat" CIO Pitch (Focus: Procurement + IT)**
"Håkan, I noticed you lead both Digital and Indirect Procurement. That’s a rare and powerful combination. We’ve found that for leaders with your scope, the biggest headache isn't just the *tech*—it's managing the fragmented vendor tail for legacy support (JD Edwards). Localhost can consolidate your Salesforce and ERP engineering streams into one managed service, reducing your procurement complexity while speeding up delivery."

**Starter 2: The Integration Bottleneck (Focus: JDE + Salesforce)**
"With your active integration between JD Edwards and Salesforce, are you finding that data synchronization latency is affecting your trading desks? We specialize in decoupling these architectures using event-driven patterns (Kafka) so your sales team sees inventory in real-time, without crashing the ERP during end-of-month reporting."

**Starter 3: The New CEO / Data Play (Focus: Doug Smith's Vision)**
"With Doug Smith taking the helm, we often see a push for 'Single Pane of Glass' visibility across divisions (Pulp, Chemicals, Recycling). Since you are already using Qlik, we can help you build a GenAI layer on top of your existing data warehouse, allowing your executives to query global trade volumes in natural language rather than waiting for static reports."
