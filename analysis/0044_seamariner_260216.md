## 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX
**[Process]: ISO 9001:2015 & MLC 2006 Compliance**
*   **The Evidence:** The company maintains strict ISO and Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) accreditation, requiring rigorous document tracking for every candidate (medical, STCW certs).
*   **The Source:** [Seamariner Quality Assurance](https://www.seamariner.com/about-us)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Data & Analytic Services** (Compliance Auditing/Document Management)

**[Platform]: Reliance on Third-Party Ecosystems**
*   **The Evidence:** Seamariner appears to utilize third-party platforms (like Martide or general job boards) rather than a proprietary, branded mobile experience for candidate document uploads.
*   **The Source:** [Seamariner Candidate Page](https://www.seamariner.com/candidates)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Software Engineering** (Custom Mobile App Development)

**[Hiring]: High-Volume Specialist Placements**
*   **The Evidence:** Active recruitment for "Master DP Multicat", "Chief Officers", and "ETO" (Electro-Technical Officers) for 2026 starts.
*   **The Source:** [Seamariner Vacancies](https://www.seamariner.com/vacancies)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **IoT & Process Automation** (Automated Candidate Matching)

## 3. SERVICES & STACK INTERSECTION
Comparison of Seamariner Limited Stack vs. Localhost Official Services.

✅ **The Sweet Spot (Direct Service Matches):**
*   **Software Engineering (Mobile):** The "ML" tag in your data is likely a misclassification for "Maritime Logistics" or a database error. However, the opportunity is real: Seamariner risks platform dependency.
    *   *Why it fits:* They need a **"Seamariner Companion App"** allowing seafarers to upload certifications directly to Seamariner's database, bypassing generic job boards.
    *   *Tech Validation:* Currently using standard web forms; a shift to a React Native/Flutter app would increase candidate retention.

⚠️ **The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent/Upsell):**
*   **Data & Analytic Services:**
    *   *The Angle:* Managing expiration dates for thousands of seafarer documents (STCW, Medicals) is a data nightmare. We can pitch a **Predictive Compliance Engine** that alerts candidates *before* they become ineligible.
*   **Cloud Services (Migration):**
    *   *The Angle:* As a legacy firm (est. 1992), they likely hold decades of candidate data in on-premise or disparate systems. Migrating to a unified Azure/AWS data lake would unlock the value of their "Passive Candidate" pool.

❌ **The Mismatch (Out of Scope):**
*   **AI & ML (Generative):**
    *   *Reason:* While the input tagged them "ML", they are a recruitment agency, not a tech firm. They do not need LLM training; they need basic operational automation.
*   **Outsourcing Services:**
    *   *Reason:* They *are* a staffing agency. Pitching "Staff Augmentation" to a staffing agency is redundant unless it is specifically for their internal IT (which is small).

## 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE
**Starter 1: The "Platform Risk" Trigger**
"Warren, I noticed Seamariner has maintained ISO 9001 status since 1997—an impressive feat. However, relying on third-party portals for candidate document collection creates a data silo. Localhost can build a proprietary 'Seamariner App' that keeps that data strictly within your ecosystem."

**Starter 2: The Compliance Automation Angle**
"Managing MLC 2006 compliance for hundreds of placements usually involves heavy manual verification. We've helped regulated industries automate document expiry tracking—turning a compliance headache into an automated retention tool for your candidates."

**Starter 3: The "ML" Clarification**
"Our market data tagged Seamariner for 'Machine Learning' interest. While you likely aren't building AI models, you *are* sitting on 30 years of placement data. We can help you mine that historical data to predict which candidates are most likely to churn or accept contracts."
