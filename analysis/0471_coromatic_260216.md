## 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX (High-Signal Items 2025-2026)

**[Strategic Initiative]: Manufacturing Capacity Doubling (Jan 2026)**
*   **The Evidence:** Coromatic officially announced the doubling of production capacity at their Östersund facility in January 2026 to meet "surging demand for backup power" driven by digitization and defense needs.
*   **The Source:** [Coromatic Press Release: Östersund Expansion (Jan 2026)](https://coromatic.se/nyheter/)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **IoT & Process Automation** (Smart Manufacturing integration).

**[Service Product]: "Coromatic Operations" (24/7 Monitoring)**
*   **The Evidence:** They market a specific service called "Coromatic Operations" which connects customer facilities to their 24/7 control center. This requires a robust, multi-tenant digital platform to ingest real-time data from BMS/UPS systems.
*   **The Source:** [Coromatic Operations Service Page](https://coromatic.com/services/operations/)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Platform Development** (SaaS/Portal modernization).

**[Regulatory Pressure]: CSRD & Net Zero Reporting**
*   **The Evidence:** As an E.ON subsidiary, Coromatic is under immense pressure to provide granular sustainability data. Their "Sustainability Report 2024" emphasizes helping clients measure Scope 3 emissions from data centers.
*   **The Source:** [Coromatic Sustainability Strategy](https://coromatic.com/sustainability/)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Data & Analytic Services** (Automated ESG Reporting).

**[Hiring Signal]: Automation & Control Technicians**
*   **The Evidence:** Active recruitment for "Technician Control & Automation" and "IT Application Experts" indicates a bottleneck in connecting physical hardware (generators/cooling) to their digital IT layer.
*   **The Source:** [Coromatic Careers / Jobbsafari](https://karriar.coromatic.se/)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Software Engineering** (Middleware/Integrations).

## 3. SERVICES & STACK INTERSECTION

### ✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Service Matches)
**IoT & Process Automation**: **Connected Critical Infrastructure**
*   *Why it fits:* Coromatic sells "uptime." They are physically installing generators and UPS systems (Hardware) but need to offer "Smart Monitoring" (Software) to compete.
*   *Tech Validation:* They use **BMS** and **SCADA** protocols. Localhost can build the "Edge-to-Cloud" bridge that sucks data from these legacy industrial protocols into a modern Azure dashboard.

**Platform Development**: **"Coromatic Opsis" Modernization**
*   *Why it fits:* Their monitoring service ("Opsis") likely relies on older, on-premise style software. With the 2026 expansion, they need a scalable **SaaS-like Client Portal** where customers can log in and see their power usage/battery health in real-time.
*   *Tech Validation:* High demand for "IT Application Experts" suggests an internal push to modernize these customer-facing tools.

### ⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent/Upsell)
**Data & Analytic Services**: **The "Green Data Center" Dashboard**
*   *The Angle:* Coromatic's clients (Banks, Hospitals, Defense) now *require* carbon footprint reports.
*   *The Pitch:* "You have the raw power data. We can build the **ETL pipelines** to convert that voltage/amperage data into audit-ready CSRD Sustainability Reports for your clients."

**Cloud Services**: **Azure Migration (E.ON Alignment)**
*   *The Angle:* As part of E.ON, they are likely pushed toward Azure.
*   *The Pitch:* "We can manage the **Cloud Native** transition of your monitoring center, moving from on-prem servers to Azure IoT Hub for better scalability and lower maintenance costs."

### ❌ The Mismatch (Out of Scope)
**Physical Data Center Construction**:
*   *Reason:* We do not pour concrete, install cooling pipes, or wire diesel generators. We only touch the *code* that monitors them.

## 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE

### Starter 1: The "Smart Factory" Trigger (Based on Östersund Expansion)
"I saw the January announcement regarding the doubling of your Östersund capacity—congratulations. Scaling physical production often breaks the digital supply chain visibility. Localhost has helped manufacturing hubs implement **Industrial IoT** layers to track production efficiency in real-time without ripping out legacy SCADA systems."

### Starter 2: The "Compliance as a Service" Angle (Based on Sustainability)
"Your sustainability report highlights the challenge of Scope 3 measurement for data centers. We are currently seeing a trend where infrastructure providers are building **Automated ESG Dashboards** directly into their service offering. We could help Coromatic turn 'raw power data' into a premium 'Sustainability Audit' product for your banking clients."

### Starter 3: The Technical Bottleneck (Legacy BMS Integration)
"Connecting modern cloud platforms to legacy BMS and Critical Power hardware is usually a nightmare of proprietary protocols. Our engineering team specializes in building the **Middleware** that sits between your physical generators and your 'Coromatic Operations' center, ensuring you get real-time data without the manual integration headaches."
