## 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX
**[Product Launch]: Smart Marine Ecosystems (Feb 2026)**
*   **The Evidence:** On Feb 11, 2026, Barrus announced the distribution of Mercury Marine's "New Generation of Smart, Integrated Boating Innovations." This shifts their role from hardware distributor to supporting connected IoT ecosystems (SmartCraft).
*   **The Source:** [Barrus News - Feb 11, 2026](https://www.barrus.co.uk/media-centre/news/)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **IoT & Process Automation**

**[Strategic Investment]: £1M Dealer Network Upgrade (Oct 2024 - Ongoing)**
*   **The Evidence:** Barrus launched a £1M investment fund to "realign the dealer network" and enhance digital support for Mercury dealers. This budget is active and targets dealer capabilities.
*   **The Source:** [Barrus Press Release - Oct 2024](https://www.barrus.co.uk/media-centre/news/)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Platform Development** (Dealer Portals)

**[Legacy Tech Signal]: LANSA & SOAP Web Services**
*   **The Evidence:** The "Myboat247" and "Myoutdoor247" trade portals rely on **LANSA Commerce Edition** and **SOAP** protocols to talk to legacy backends (likely IBM i). This is a high-friction legacy stack ripe for modernization.

*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Software Engineering** (Legacy Modernization)

**[Robotics Expansion]: Segway Navimow & HiSun EV (Jan 2026)**
*   **The Evidence:** As of Jan 2026, Barrus is aggressively expanding into robotics (Segway Navimow) and Electric Vehicles (HiSun Stryker). These product lines require entirely new after-sales software support compared to diesel engines.

## 3. SERVICES & STACK INTERSECTION

✅ **The Sweet Spot (Direct Service Matches):**
*   **Software Engineering (Legacy Modernization):**
    *   *Why it fits:* They are running **LANSA Commerce Edition** and **SOAP** web services for their critical B2B portals ("Myboat247"). This is aging tech (10+ years old) that likely struggles with mobile responsiveness and modern API integrations.
    *   *Tech Validation:* Confirmed use of LANSA Integrator and SOAP for B&Q EDI connections.

*   **IoT & Process Automation:**
    *   *Why it fits:* The shift to **Mercury SmartCraft** and **Segway Navimow** means they are now distributing software-defined hardware. They need a layer to aggregate diagnostic data for their 3,000+ dealers.
    *   *Tech Validation:* "Smart, Integrated Boating Innovations" (Feb 2026) requires API connectivity they currently lack in their legacy ERP.

⚠️ **The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent/Upsell):**
*   **Data & Analytic Services:**
    *   *The Angle:* With 400,000+ SKUs and a shift to "Just-in-Time" dealer ordering, their legacy ERP (K8/IBM i) likely traps data. We can pitch a **Modern Data Warehouse** to predict inventory needs for the new EV/Robotics lines.
    *   *The Angle:* "Your new robotics division generates usage data. Are you capturing it to predict spare parts demand?"

*   **Cloud Services (Azure/AWS):**
    *   *The Angle:* Their Non-Exec Director, **Neil Thompson**, is an ex-Microsoft executive. He will understand the value of moving their on-premise legacy infrastructure to Azure.
    *   *The Angle:* "Migrate the Myboat247 portal to a Cloud-Native architecture to improve uptime for dealers."

❌ **The Mismatch (Out of Scope):**
*   **Mainframe/IBM i Low-Level Maintenance:**
    *   *Reason:* While we can modernize *off* the IBM i (AS/400), we should not bid on maintaining the RPG/COBOL code itself if that is their core ERP logic.

## 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE

**Starter 1: The "Dealer Experience" Trigger**
"I noticed your recent £1M investment into the Mercury dealer network. While financial support is great, most distributors find that their **LANSA-based trade portals** become the bottleneck for modern dealers expecting a 'Amazon-like' B2B experience. We specialize in decoupling those legacy portals to boost dealer self-service."

**Starter 2: The "Robotics Data" Angle**
"With the Jan 2026 launch of the **Segway Navimow** and **HiSun EV** lines, you are moving from mechanical to digital product support. Are your current systems set up to ingest diagnostic data from these devices, or are you relying on the OEM's siloed portals? We can build a unified 'Barrus Connect' layer."

**Starter 3: The "Neil Thompson/Microsoft" Connection**
"Given Neil Thompson's background at Microsoft, I assume there is board-level pressure to modernize your IT infrastructure. We can help you migrate the **Myboat247** and **Myoutdoor247** workloads to Azure, reducing your reliance on on-premise hardware and SOAP integrations."
