# 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX

**[Hiring]: Azure Data Engineer (Snowflake/Power BI)**
*   **The Evidence:** Active recruitment for engineers to "design, build, deploy and maintain data pipelines utilising Azure Data Factory to consolidate data in a Snowflake data warehouse."
*   **The Source:** [INEOS Careers - IT Data Engineer](https://www.ineos.com/careers/)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Data & Analytic Services**

**[Strategic Initiative]: Project ONE (Antwerp) Digitalization**
*   **The Evidence:** Construction of the "most energy-efficient ethane cracker in Europe" (Project ONE) utilizing "best available techniques" and digital process control for a 2027 startup. This implies a massive Green/Brownfield IoT implementation.
*   **The Source:** [Project ONE Status Update Sept 2025](https://project-one.ineos.com/en/)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **IoT & Process Automation**

**[Hiring]: Azure DevOps Engineer (Automotive Division)**
*   **The Evidence:** Hiring for experts in "ARM templates, setup automation (Azure PowerShell), Terraform/Ansible" to manage CI/CD pipelines for the Grenadier connected vehicle platform.
*   **The Source:** [INEOS Automotive Jobs 2025](https://ineosgrenadier.com/careers)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **DevOps & Cybersecurity**

**[Hiring]: Data Scientist - Operations (Upstream)**
*   **The Evidence:** Role focused on "partnering with field operations" to "develop data-driven solutions to automate workflows" using Python/ML.
*   **The Source:** [INEOS Energy Careers](https://www.ineos.com/businesses/ineos-energy/careers/)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **AI & ML**

**[Corporate Strategy]: Automotive Commercial Restructuring**
*   **The Evidence:** Nov 2025 announcement of "strategic measures" to refocus INEOS Automotive from an engineering phase to a "market-focused commercial business," implying a need for Scalable Sales/CRM Platforms.

# 3. SERVICES & STACK INTERSECTION

## ✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Service Matches)
**Cloud Services (Azure Native):**
*   **Evidence:** Explicit requirement for "Azure Solutions Architect Expert" and use of AKS (Kubernetes), Azure Functions, and Logic Apps.
*   **Why it fits:** They are not just "in the cloud"; they are building cloud-native applications for their Automotive and Energy sectors.
*   **Tech Validation:** Azure, ARM Templates, Terraform.

**Data & Analytic Services:**
*   **Evidence:** The move to **Snowflake** sitting behind **Azure Data Factory** is a textbook modern data stack.
*   **Why it fits:** They are consolidating data from 36 businesses. They need robust ETL/ELT pipelines to feed Power BI dashboards for executive reporting.

**DevOps & Cybersecurity:**
*   **Evidence:** The Automotive division is operating like a software company (Connected Car), requiring strict CI/CD pipelines and "Security by Design."
*   **Why it fits:** Industrial assets (Chemicals) + Consumer assets (Cars) create a massive attack surface requiring converged IT/OT security audits.

## ⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent/Upsell)
**AI & ML (Generative & Predictive):**
*   **The Angle:** They are hiring Data Scientists for *operations* (efficiency), but with their massive documentation load (Compliance/Safety), a **GenAI Knowledge Base** (RAG) for plant technicians would be a high-value pitch.
*   **The Angle:** "Azure OpenAI" is listed as a preferred qualification in their job posts—they are *curious* but likely need help scaling it beyond PoCs.

**IoT & Process Automation (Digital Twins):**
*   **The Angle:** **Project ONE** is a billion-dollar asset. While the hardware is likely Honeywell/Siemens, the *software layer* (Digital Twin, predictive maintenance dashboards) is where Localhost can bridge the gap between OT data and IT decision-making.

## ❌ The Mismatch (Out of Scope)
**Commodity Web Design / Marketing Agencies:**
*   **Reason:** INEOS partners with high-end agencies (like those handling Mercedes F1 marketing) for brand visuals. Localhost should focus on the *backend* of these platforms, not the creative frontend.

# 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE

## Starter 1: The "Project ONE" Data Backbone
"I've been following the progress of **Project ONE** in Antwerp. While the physical engineering is impressive, many chemical majors struggle with the 'Day 2' data integration—getting that new OT data into the corporate Snowflake environment without latency. We specialize in building those high-throughput bridges for industrial clients."

## Starter 2: The Automotive Pivot
"With INEOS Automotive shifting focus from 'Engineering' to 'Commercial Operations' (as per the Nov '25 update), your digital platforms need to change from R&D tools to high-scale Customer Experience engines. We have deep experience refactoring Azure-native platforms to handle that kind of commercial scale."

## Starter 3: The Snowflake/Azure Optimization
"We noticed you are aggressively hiring for the **Azure Data Factory + Snowflake** stack. A common bottleneck we see in this specific architecture is spiraling cloud costs as data ingestion scales. Our Data Engineering team typically reduces Azure/Snowflake spend by ~20% through optimized pipeline architecture—would you be open to a brief audit?"
