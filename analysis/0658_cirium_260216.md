## 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX

**[AI Product Launch]: OTP AI (Generative AI for Operations)**
*   **The Evidence:** Cirium launched "OTP AI" in June 2025 and "OTP Awards AI" in Jan 2025. These are GenAI assistants designed to replace SQL queries with natural language for airline operational analysis.
*   **The Source:** [Cirium Press Release - June 2025](https://www.cirium.com/thoughtcloud)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **AI & ML**

**[Hiring Signal]: Senior Software Engineer II (Data Curation)**
*   **The Evidence:** Active job post (Jan 22, 2026) for a "Senior Software Engineer II" to work on "Schedules Transformers." The role requires deep understanding of data processing, C#, and Python to power the "foundational Cirium dataset."
*   **The Source:** [Cirium Careers / RELX Jobs - Jan 2026](https://relx.wd3.myworkdayjobs.com/Cirium)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Software Engineering**

**[Sustainability Platform]: EmeraldSky Methodology Updates**
*   **The Evidence:** Ongoing 2025-2026 updates to "EmeraldSky," their proprietary CO2 emissions tracking architecture. This requires massive historical data ingestion (5 years+) and predictive modeling for Scope 3 reporting.
*   **The Source:** [Cirium EmeraldSky Methodology 2025](https://www.cirium.com/solutions/cirium-sustainability/)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Data & Analytic Services**

**[Strategic Shift]: "Data Lakes to Data Conversations"**
*   **The Evidence:** Niha Shaikh (VP Product) explicitly stated in late 2025 that the company strategy is moving from "dashboards and SQL" to "Natural Language Interfaces" (GenAI).

## 3. SERVICES & STACK INTERSECTION

### ✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Service Matches)
*   **AI & ML:** Cirium is aggressively productizing GenAI (OTP AI). They need **LLM Ops** and **Agentic Workflows** to ensure these natural language interfaces don't hallucinate on critical aviation data.
    *   *Why it fits:* They are explicitly building "Aviation AI Assistants."
    *   *Tech Validation:* Validated by their move to "Natural Language Interfaces" over SQL.
*   **Data & Analytic Services:** The "Schedules Transformers" project indicates a need for high-throughput ETL/ELT pipelines.
    *   *Why it fits:* They ingest 35M+ flights/year. The job posts mention "complex data models" and "optimization techniques."
    *   *Tech Validation:* Use of **Snowflake** and **Spark** (implied by "Big Data" stack).

### ⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent/Upsell)
*   **Cloud Services (FinOps):** Processing global flight data in real-time on AWS is expensive.
    *   *The Angle:* "With the launch of EmeraldSky and OTP AI, your compute costs are likely spiking. We can implement **FinOps** to optimize the AWS spend for these high-intensity workloads."
*   **DevOps & Cybersecurity:** As they expose more data via APIs and GenAI agents, security becomes paramount.
    *   *The Angle:* "Exposing proprietary data via GenAI agents creates new attack vectors (Prompt Injection). We can audit the security of your new AI layer."

### ❌ The Mismatch (Out of Scope)
*   **Hardware / IoT Manufacturing:** While they track IoT data (flight sensors), they do not manufacture the sensors.
    *   *Reason:* They are a data aggregator, not a hardware manufacturer.

## 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE

**Starter 1: The "Data Conversation" Trigger**
"I read Niha Shaikh's recent piece on moving from 'Data Lakes to Data Conversations.' While the vision is powerful, we often see clients struggle with the **latency and accuracy** of LLMs when querying structured SQL databases. How are you handling the 'hallucination risk' for critical operational queries in OTP AI?"

**Starter 2: The Sustainability Data Bottleneck**
"With the 2026 updates to **EmeraldSky**, the volume of historical flight data you need to process for Scope 3 reporting must be massive. Localhost's Data Engineering team specializes in optimizing **ETL pipelines** for high-compliance sectors—we could potentially reduce your data processing costs by 15-20%."

**Starter 3: The Talent Gap (Schedules Transformers)**
"I noticed you are hiring for the 'Schedules Transformers' team in the UK. Finding engineers who are proficient in both **C# legacy systems** and **modern Python data pipelines** is difficult. We have a dedicated 'Legacy Modernization' pod that could accelerate your roadmap while you fill those permanent roles."
