# 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX

**1. [Hiring]: Data Engineering & Azure Scaling**
*   **The Evidence:** Active recruitment for "Data Scientist/Engineer" and "Clearing Data Engineer" roles. Specific requirements include building scalable ETL pipelines on **Databricks**, using **Python**, and maintaining **MS SQL Server** clusters.
*   **The Source:** [APG Careers / DevJobs.at Listing](https://devjobs.at/job/apg-austrian-power-grid-ag-data-scientist-engineer)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Data Science & ML (Python/Pandas), Cloud DevOps (Azure).

**2. [Strategic Initiative]: The €9 Billion Grid Expansion**
*   **The Evidence:** APG has committed to a €9 billion investment plan through 2034 ("Masterplan 2030") to modernize the grid. This includes the "Digital Grid" initiative to handle the volatility of renewable energy integration.
*   **The Source:** [APG Network Development Plan 2024](https://www.apg.at/en/power-grid/network-development-plan)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Application Development (Modernization of legacy grid management tools).

**3. [Project]: "INSIEME" & European Energy Data Space**
*   **The Evidence:** APG is a consortium partner in "INSIEME," a project to build the Common European Energy Data Space (CEEDS). This requires massive cross-border data exchange, security protocols, and cloud-edge connectivity.
*   **The Source:** [APG Innovation Projects](https://www.apg.at/en/innovation)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Backend Development (Node.js/FastAPI for API layers), Cloud DevOps (Infrastructure as Code).

**4. [Technology]: Internal Tooling with Streamlit/Dash**
*   **The Evidence:** Job descriptions explicitly mention creating "interactive dashboards with **Streamlit** and **Dash**." This indicates a heavy reliance on Python-based rapid prototyping tools for internal business intelligence.
*   **The Source:** [APG Data Scientist Job Description](https://devjobs.at/job/apg-austrian-power-grid-ag-data-scientist-engineer)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Frontend Development (React/Next.js) — *Opportunity to upgrade fragile Python scripts to robust React applications.*

**5. [Leadership Signal]: CIO Focus on "Blackout Prevention via Cybersecurity"**
*   **The Evidence:** CIO Markus Kasinger won the 2023 CIO Award for his strategy on "Preventing Blackouts with Cybersecurity" and IT resilience. This signals a high budget priority for observability and secure infrastructure.
*   **The Source:** [Confare CIO Award Interview](https://confare.at/cio-award/)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Observability & ITSM (Monitoring/Incident Management).

# 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Azure:** The core of their enterprise cloud strategy.
*   **Python:** The primary language for their Data Science and Energy Modeling teams.
*   **SQL Server:** Used for critical "Clearing" and metering data storage.
*   **Data Science Core:** Usage of ETL pipelines aligns with **Pandas/Numpy** capabilities.

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **Streamlit/Dash → React/Next.js:** They are building internal tools with Python libraries (Streamlit). As these tools scale, they become unmaintainable. We can pitch **React/Next.js** for enterprise-grade internal portals.
*   **Databricks → Cloud Native:** While they use Databricks, our **Azure DevOps** and **Kubernetes** expertise can help optimize the underlying compute clusters and deployment pipelines.
*   **Manual SQL Clusters → Modern Data Warehouse:** They mention "Always On" SQL clusters. Opportunity to modernize into **Snowflake** or managed Azure SQL instances.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **SAP SuccessFactors:** Used for HR/Training administration (We do not support SAP).
*   **OT/SCADA Specifics:** Proprietary operational technology hardware (Siemens/ABB) is out of scope for us.

# 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Starter 1: The "Prototype to Production" Pitch**
*   **The Trigger:** Their heavy use of **Streamlit** and **Dash** for internal data products (found in job ads).
*   **The Logical Friction:** Python-based dashboards are great for prototypes but often fail at enterprise scale (performance, security, state management) when used by hundreds of grid operators.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "We can deploy a **React/Next.js** squad to refactor your critical Streamlit dashboards into performant, secure internal applications, keeping your Data Scientists focused on models, not UI code."

**Starter 2: The "Data Tsunami" Engineering Support**
*   **The Trigger:** The **€9 Billion investment** and the "INSIEME" data space project.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Ingesting real-time metering data from millions of renewable sources (PV, Wind) creates a "cardinality explosion" that legacy **SQL Server** clusters struggle to handle without massive maintenance overhead.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Our **Azure Data Engineering** experts can help optimize your ETL pipelines and migrate high-volume metering data to modern architectures, ensuring your 'Digital Grid' initiatives don't hit a database bottleneck."

**Starter 3: The CIO's Resilience Mandate**
*   **The Trigger:** Markus Kasinger’s specific focus on **IT Resilience** and preventing blackouts via software stability.
*   **The Logical Friction:** As the grid becomes software-defined, "silent failures" in microservices become the new blackout risk. Traditional monitoring isn't enough for distributed Azure environments.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Aligning with your 'Security of Supply' mission, we can implement deep **Observability (Grafana/Prometheus)** pipelines to give your operations center real-time visibility into the *software* health of the grid, not just the physical lines."
