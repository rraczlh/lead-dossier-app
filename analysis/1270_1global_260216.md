# 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX

**[Platform]: The "API Economy" Pivot**
**The Evidence:** 1GLOBAL has aggressively shifted from a traditional MVNO to an API-first platform ("1GLOBAL Connect"), enabling non-telcos like **Revolut** and **Freenet** to sell eSIMs directly in their apps.

**Localhost Service Map:** **Platform Development**

**[Engineering]: Cloud-Native Migration**
**The Evidence:** Active recruitment for "Senior Backend Engineers (Java/GCP)" to "migrate legacy systems into a cloud-native, microservices architecture" and manage high-scale distributed systems using BigTable.

**[Partnership]: White-Label Telco Solutions**
**The Evidence:** Launched "SimWallet" with Dutch operator **Odido**, a standalone app powered entirely by 1GLOBAL's multi-IMSI architecture and APIs, requiring rapid integration cycles (4 weeks).

**[Compliance]: RegTech for Finance**
**The Evidence:** They maintain a specific "Compliance Recording" product line for Tier-1 banks (MIFID II regulations), requiring immutable storage and high-security data handling.

# 3. SERVICES & STACK INTERSECTION

## ✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Service Matches)
**Platform Development (API Economy)**
*   **The Need:** They are building the "Stripe for Telco." Their growth depends entirely on the stability, documentation, and scalability of the **1GLOBAL Connect API**.
*   **Tech Validation:** Use of **Node.js** and **OAuth 2.0** for their external-facing developer portals.
*   **Fit:** We can accelerate their API roadmap, specifically building SDKs for mobile (iOS/Android) to make it easier for partners (like Revolut) to integrate.

**Software Engineering (Legacy Modernization)**
*   **The Need:** Explicitly hiring to "migrate legacy systems" (likely the old Truphone stack) to **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.
*   **Tech Validation:** Heavy reliance on **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **Postgres**.
*   **Fit:** They are resource-constrained in London/Lisbon. We can provide a dedicated pod of Java engineers to handle the "lift and shift" of the legacy core network components.

## ⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent/Upsell)
**Data & Analytic Services (Big Data)**
*   **The Angle:** They are using **GCP BigTable** to handle massive roaming data streams.
*   **The Pitch:** "As you scale to millions of Revolut users, your BigTable costs and query latencies will spike. We can optimize your schema design and implement a modern Data Lakehouse for real-time usage analytics."

**DevOps & Cybersecurity (Compliance)**
*   **The Angle:** Their "Compliance Recording" product for banks requires military-grade security.
*   **The Pitch:** "We can perform automated penetration testing and 'Infrastructure as Code' audits on your recording storage to ensure you never fail a MIFID II audit."

## ❌ The Mismatch (Out of Scope)
**Hardware / Chip Manufacturing**
*   **Reason:** While they deal with eSIMs, the actual physical SIM manufacturing or low-level chip firmware (if any remains) is outside our scope. We focus on the *Remote SIM Provisioning (RSP)* software, not the hardware.

# 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE

**Starter 1: The "API Economy" Scalability**
"I saw the success of the Revolut integration—congratulations. Typically, when telco platforms open APIs to consumer apps with millions of users, the 'thundering herd' problem becomes a risk during travel peak seasons. How is your current Node.js layer handling those sudden spikes in eSIM provisioning requests?"

**Starter 2: The Legacy Migration**
"I noticed you are actively recruiting Java engineers to migrate the legacy Truphone stack to GCP. We've found that the hardest part of these migrations isn't the code—it's maintaining data consistency between the old Oracle/On-prem DBs and the new BigTable instances. Localhost has a blueprint for this specific 'strangler fig' migration pattern."

**Starter 3: The Compliance Data Trap**
"With your MIFID II recording solution, are you finding it expensive to store years of immutable voice data on standard cloud storage? We often help RegTech clients implement tiered storage lifecycles that reduce costs by 40% while maintaining instant retrieval for auditors."
