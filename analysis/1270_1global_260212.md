2. THE EVIDENCE BOX (High-Signal Items 2025-2026)
*Context: 1GLOBAL (formerly Truphone) is aggressively expanding its API-first eSIM and compliance platforms.*

**[Product Launch]: Message+ for Microsoft Teams (Compliance)**
*   **The Evidence:** Launched "Message+" in mid-2025, a compliance tool integrating SMS/WhatsApp capture directly into Microsoft Teams. This requires deep integration between their core telco stack (AWS) and the Microsoft ecosystem.
*   **The Source:** [1GLOBAL Launches Message+ on Microsoft Teams](https://www.businesswire.com)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** **Azure OpenAI** (for potential transcription/analysis) or **.NET Core** (Teams Apps).

**[Hiring]: Senior DevSecOps Engineer (Kubernetes/AWS)**
*   **The Evidence:** Active recruitment for "Senior DevSecOps Engineer" in Lisbon/Berlin. Requirements include "Hands-on experience with Kubernetes security," "Terraform," and "AWS."
*   **The Source:** [1GLOBAL Careers - Senior DevSecOps Engineer](https://workable.com/1global)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** **Kubernetes**, **Terraform**, **AWS Lambda**.

**[Partnership]: Revolut & N26 API Integration**
*   **The Evidence:** 1GLOBAL powers the eSIM offerings for major fintechs like Revolut and N26 via their "Connect API." This indicates a massive need for high-availability API gateways and low-latency backend processing.
*   **The Source:** [1GLOBAL Empowers Revolut to Offer Mobile Plans](https://www.1global.com)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** **Go**, **GraphQL**, **PostgreSQL**.

**[Engineering]: Network Automation Initiative**
*   **The Evidence:** Job posts for "IP Network Team Lead" explicitly demand expertise in "Network Automation & IaC" using **Terraform** and **Ansible** to replace legacy manual provisioning.
*   **The Source:** [IP Network Team Lead Job Description](https://workable.com/1global)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** **Ansible**, **Terraform**, **Python**.

**[Hiring]: Lead Full-Stack Engineer (Node.js)**
*   **The Evidence:** Hiring for a Lead Engineer to drive their "Global Connectivity Platform" dashboard, utilizing **Node.js** and **React**.
*   **The Source:** [Lead Full-Stack Engineer (NodeJS) - Lisbon](https://workable.com/1global)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** **Node.js**, **React**, **Next.js**.

3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION
**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Core Backend:** **Java** and **Go** are the engines of their connectivity platform.
*   **Cloud Native:** Heavy reliance on **AWS**, **Kubernetes**, and **Docker** for their "Connect API" and eSIM platforms.
*   **Infrastructure as Code:** Explicit use of **Terraform** and **Ansible** for network automation.
*   **Data:** **PostgreSQL** and **Kafka** (implied for high-throughput telco messaging).

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **Microsoft Ecosystem Bridge:** While their core is AWS, the **Message+** product lives in **Microsoft Teams**. They likely need **.NET Core** or **Azure Functions** expertise to bridge these worlds, which is a perfect cross-sell for Localhost's Azure capabilities.
*   **Observability Migration:** They mention **Prometheus** and **Grafana**. If they are scaling to millions of eSIMs (Revolut deal), they may need help optimizing metric cardinality or migrating to managed services like **Datadog** (which we support).

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **Oracle BRM:** They use Oracle's Billing and Revenue Management system (legacy telco billing), which is not in the Localhost matrix.
*   **SIP/Telecom Core:** Specific telecom protocols (SIP, SMPP, SS7) are domain-specific and outside standard web engineering.

4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The "Teams vs. AWS" Integration Gap**
*   **The Trigger:** Their launch of *Message+* for Microsoft Teams while running a heavy AWS core.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Maintaining seamless, secure, and compliant data flow between a Microsoft SaaS environment (Teams) and an AWS backend is notoriously difficult, often leading to latency issues or compliance gaps (e.g., data residency).
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Mikael, with the success of Message+, are you finding friction in bridging the Azure/Teams ecosystem with your core AWS infrastructure? Localhost has a dedicated 'Cloud Bridge' squad that specializes in **.NET Core** to **AWS Lambda** integrations to ensure your compliance recording is instant and seamless."

**Conversation Starter 2: API Reliability at Fintech Scale**
*   **The Trigger:** The massive volume influx from the Revolut and N26 partnerships.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Fintech partners demand 99.999% availability. Scaling legacy Java monoliths to handle millions of concurrent eSIM activations often results in "noisy neighbor" problems and database bottlenecks.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Supporting the N26 and Revolut user base is a huge win, but it puts immense pressure on API gateways. We can deploy a **Go** and **Kubernetes** optimization pod to audit your 'Connect API' for concurrency bottlenecks, ensuring you meet the strict SLAs these fintech unicorns demand."

**Conversation Starter 3: Accelerating Network Automation**
*   **The Trigger:** The active search for "Network Automation" leads using Terraform/Ansible.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Transitioning from manual network provisioning to "Infrastructure as Code" is slow and error-prone. Internal teams often struggle to balance maintaining the legacy network while writing the new Terraform modules.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "I noticed you're aggressively hiring to automate your IP network with **Terraform** and **Ansible**. Localhost can provide a 'DevOps Accelerator' team to write the foundational IaC modules for your global backbone, allowing your core engineers to focus on architecture rather than writing boilerplate configuration code."
