### 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX (High-Signal Items)

**[Hiring]: Senior Engineer (Python/GCP) - London**
*   **The Evidence:** Active recruitment for a Senior Engineer to build internal client-facing tools using "Python & Django (backend) and Vue.js (frontend), deployed with Docker on GCP."
*   **The Source:** [CareerStructure Job Listing - Feb 4, 2026](https://www.careerstructure.com/job/senior-engineer/brainlabs-job)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Application Development (Python/Django/Vue.js) & DevOps (GCP/Docker).

**[Strategic]: Acquisition of Exverus Media**
*   **The Evidence:** In July 2025, Brainlabs acquired Exverus Media to expand US West Coast operations. The press release explicitly mentions integrating Exverus's data with Brainlabs' proprietary "Cortex AI" platform.
*   **The Source:** [Brainlabs Press Release - July 22, 2025](https://www.brainlabsdigital.com/news/acquisition-exverus)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Data & AI (Integration of disparate data sources into Cortex AI).

**[Product]: Proprietary "Cortex AI" Platform Development**
*   **The Evidence:** Brainlabs is aggressively marketing its "Real Intelligence" approach, powered by "Cortex AI". This requires continuous ML engineering and backend support to process data from \$1B+ in media billings.
*   **The Source:** [MarTech360 - Brainlabs AI Strategy](https://martech360.com/ai/brainlabs-acquires-exverus)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** AI/ML Engineering (Python) & Cloud Infrastructure (GCP).

### 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Backend:** **Python**, **Django** (Explicitly listed in Feb 2026 job post).
*   **Frontend:** **Vue.js** (Explicitly listed in Feb 2026 job post).
*   **Cloud & DevOps:** **GCP** (Google Cloud Platform), **Docker** (Explicitly listed).
*   **Data:** **SQL** (Implied by "Data Strategy" roles and GMP focus).

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **Google Marketing Platform (GMP):** They are a premier GMP partner. While we don't manage ads, we can offer **Data Engineering** to pipe GMP data into BigQuery (GCP) for their "Cortex AI" analysis.
*   **Airflow:** Common in GCP/Python data stacks; likely used for their orchestration given the volume of media data.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **Medical Technology:** *Note: Do not confuse with "Brainlab" (German medical co). Brainlabs Digital is purely Marketing/AdTech.*
*   **Creative Design Tools:** Adobe Suite (InDesign/Photoshop) mentioned in stack, but outside Localhost engineering scope.

### 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The Post-Acquisition Data Tangle**
*   **The Trigger:** The July 2025 acquisition of **Exverus Media** and the 2024 acquisition of **Sparro**.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Integrating historical data from acquired agencies into the **Cortex AI** platform is notoriously difficult. They likely have fragmented data pipelines and "Excel hell" from the legacy systems of acquired firms.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Ben, merging Exverus's data structures into Cortex AI is likely creating a backlog for your core engineering team. Localhost can deploy a **Python/GCP Data Squad** to handle the ETL migration and pipeline standardization, allowing your internal team to focus on new AI feature development."

**Conversation Starter 2: Scaling "Cortex AI" Infrastructure**
*   **The Trigger:** The shift to "Real Intelligence" and the explicit hiring of Python/Django engineers for internal tools (Feb 2026).
*   **The Logical Friction:** As media billings hit \$1B, the compute load on **Cortex AI** (hosted on GCP) will spike. Internal tools often suffer from performance degradation as user count grows globally.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "With the expansion to the US West Coast, latency and uptime for your internal tools are critical. We can provide **Site Reliability Engineers (SREs)** specialized in **GCP and Docker** to optimize your container orchestration, ensuring Cortex AI remains performant for your global account teams."

**Conversation Starter 3: Frontend Modernization for Client Portals**
*   **The Trigger:** The specific request for **Vue.js** developers in their London office.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Client-facing dashboards in AdTech require constant iteration to display complex data simply. Finding senior Vue.js talent who also understand the backend (Django) constraints is a bottleneck.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "We noticed you're building out new client-facing capabilities in **Vue.js**. Localhost has ready-to-deploy **Full-Stack (Django + Vue)** developers who can accelerate your dashboard roadmap, ensuring your clients get real-time visibility into their campaign performance without delaying your product release cycle."
