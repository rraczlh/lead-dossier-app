# 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX

**TYPE: ARCHITECTURAL OVERHAUL**
**Signal Title:** KPMG Clara Platform "Agentic AI" Modernization
**The Evidence:** KPMG has fundamentally re-architected its flagship audit platform, *KPMG Clara*, to run on **Microsoft Azure** using **Azure OpenAI** and **.NET**. They are explicitly moving from standard cloud hosting to an "Agentic AI" model, requiring deep integration between C# backends and Python-based AI services.

**Mapping-2-Localhost:** `Azure` + `OpenAI` + `.NET Core` + `Python`

**TYPE: STRATEGIC ALLIANCE**
**Signal Title:** 2025 ServiceNow Worldwide Transformation Partner
**The Evidence:** KPMG was named the "2025 ServiceNow Worldwide Transformation Partner of the Year." This indicates a massive pipeline of ServiceNow implementation work that often exceeds internal capacity, specifically for "Enterprise Workflow" projects.

**Mapping-2-Localhost:** `ServiceNow` + `JavaScript`

**TYPE: HIRING SURGE**
**Signal Title:** Azure Engineering Capacity Gaps in Amstelveen
**The Evidence:** Active job listings for "Senior Cloud Engineer" and "Azure Cloud Operations Engineer" in the Netherlands. The roles specifically demand **Azure DevOps** (CI/CD), **Infrastructure as Code (Bicep/ARM)**, and **Python** scripting for automation.

**Mapping-2-Localhost:** `Azure DevOps` + `Python` + `Bicep`

**TYPE: LOW-CODE EXPANSION**
**Signal Title:** Power Platform/Low-Code "Citizen Developer" Scaling
**The Evidence:** KPMG Advisory is aggressively selling "Connected Enterprise" solutions leveraging the Microsoft Power Platform. They require technical governance and backend integration (Power Fx) to prevent "shadow IT" sprawl in client environments.

# 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Cloud & DevOps:** `Azure` (Primary), `Azure DevOps` (CI/CD).
*   **Application Development:** `.NET Core` (KPMG Clara Backend), `C#`, `Python` (AI/Automation).
*   **AI & Data:** `OpenAI` (Azure OpenAI Service), `Pandas` (Data Analysis).
*   **Business Apps:** `ServiceNow`, `Power Fx` (Power Platform).

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **Databricks:** They use Databricks heavily for data engineering. While not in our primary matrix, our `Python` and `Spark` (via Scala/Python) capabilities allow us to staff these pods effectively.
*   **Cosmos DB:** Used in KPMG Clara. We support `DynamoDB` and `SQL Server`; migrating or supporting Cosmos DB via our NoSQL expertise is a viable bridge.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **Oracle Cloud:** While they audit Oracle systems, their internal build strategy is overwhelmingly Microsoft-centric.
*   **AWS:** They have AWS capabilities for clients, but their *internal* IP (Clara, Digital Gateway) is Azure-native. Selling AWS modernization to them is an uphill battle compared to Azure optimization.

# 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The "Clara" AI Integration Gap**
*   **The Trigger:** The shift of *KPMG Clara* to an "Agentic AI" architecture using Azure OpenAI.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Integrating non-deterministic AI agents into a rigid, compliance-heavy .NET audit framework creates massive "glue code" debt. Their internal teams are likely struggling to bridge the gap between C# backend engineers and Python AI data scientists.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Marieke, we see you're moving Clara to an Agentic model. Localhost can deploy 'Hybrid Pods'—engineers fluent in both **.NET Core** and **Langchain/Python**—to build the middleware that safely connects your AI agents to your audit core, accelerating your roadmap without distracting your core product team."

**Conversation Starter 2: The ServiceNow Implementation Overflow**
*   **The Trigger:** Winning the "2025 Worldwide Transformation Partner" award.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Awards like this typically follow a surge in enterprise deal flow. The friction is **delivery capacity**: finding enough certified ServiceNow architects to handle the customization (JavaScript/Angular) required for complex client deployments.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Congratulations on the Partner of the Year win. We know this volume of work puts pressure on your implementation squads. Localhost can serve as your 'White Label' technical bench, handling the heavy lifting on **ServiceNow custom app dev** and integrations, allowing your partners to focus on high-level strategy and client relationships."

**Conversation Starter 3: Azure DevOps Governance**
*   **The Trigger:** Active hiring for Azure Cloud Engineers with IAC (Infrastructure as Code) focus in Amstelveen.
*   **The Logical Friction:** As they scale digital services, maintaining consistent **Bicep/ARM** templates across hundreds of client environments becomes a governance nightmare. Manual provisioning is likely slowing down their "Connected Enterprise" delivery.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "We noticed your focus on scaling Azure delivery in the Netherlands. Localhost specializes in **Azure DevOps** pipeline standardization. We can audit and refactor your IaC library, ensuring that every digital solution you deliver to clients is secure-by-design and deployable in minutes, not days."
