## 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX
**[Platform]: Global CargoWise Rollout Completed (Dec 2025)**
**The Evidence:** deugro successfully completed the global rollout of CargoWise in December 2025 across 70 offices. This "CargoWise NEO" initiative is now the backbone of their digital operations, requiring continuous integration and data optimization.
**The Source:** [deugro Press Release - Jan 14, 2026](https://deugro.com)
**Localhost Service Map:** **Platform Development** (Integrations)

**[Analytics]: Scope 3 Emissions Tracking Push**
**The Evidence:** The "Sustainability Report 2024" (released April 2025) emphasizes Scope 3 emissions tracking (subcontracted logistics). They are using "EcoTransIT" but face challenges in aggregating data from fragmented subcontractors to meet CSRD compliance.
**The Source:** [Project Cargo Journal - June 2025](https://projectcargojournal.com)
**Localhost Service Map:** **Data & Analytic Services**

**[Engineering]: Hiring Azure & DevOps Talent**
**The Evidence:** Recent job postings for "Cloud-Lösungen (Azure/AWS)" and "Mid/Senior Azure DevOps Engineer" indicate an internal shift towards cloud-native custom development to supplement their bought software.
**The Source:** [Stepstone / JobStreet - Feb 2026](https://stepstone.de)
**Localhost Service Map:** **Cloud Services**

**[Product]: Visiotrack "Predictive" Features**
**The Evidence:** Their proprietary client portal, **deugro visiotrack**, is being marketed with "predictive analysis" capabilities. This suggests an active need for ML models to predict delays based on weather/port congestion.

## 3. SERVICES & STACK INTERSECTION
**Comparison of deugro Stack vs. Localhost Official Services**

✅ **The Sweet Spot (Direct Service Matches):**
*   **Data & Analytic Services:** They are drowning in supply chain data from their new CargoWise core and legacy Visiotrack system.
    *   *Why it fits:* The 2024 Sustainability Report explicitly mentions the difficulty of tracking **Scope 3 emissions** (99.8% of their impact). They need automated ETL pipelines to pull data from subcontractors into Power BI/EcoTransIT for CSRD compliance.
    *   *Tech Validation:* Confirmed use of **Power BI** and **EcoTransIT**.

*   **Platform Development:** Enhancing **deugro visiotrack**.
    *   *Why it fits:* Visiotrack is their competitive differentiator against digital-first forwarders (like Flexport). They need to build custom APIs to pull real-time data from CargoWise and display it on the Visiotrack client dashboard.
    *   *Tech Validation:* Hiring "Web Developers" and "System Analysts".

⚠️ **The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent/Upsell):**
*   **AI & ML:** Predictive Logistics.
    *   *The Angle:* They market "predictive analysis" to clients. Localhost can pitch a **GenAI agent** that scans unstructured emails/PDFs from port authorities to predict delays *before* they happen, feeding this directly into Visiotrack.
*   **Cloud Services:** Azure FinOps.
    *   *The Angle:* With the massive shift to CargoWise (SaaS) and Azure-based internal tools, their cloud spend is likely spiking. A **FinOps audit** is a low-friction entry point.

❌ **The Mismatch (Out of Scope):**
*   **Hardware Manufacturing:** They operate vessels (Rotra Futura) and trucks but do not manufacture them. Do not pitch IoT hardware design, only the *software integration* of existing sensor data.

## 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE
**Conversation Starters for Nicole Lau (Global Head of Business Process Optimization) or Mario Hess (Head of Customer Solutions):**

**Starter 1: The "Post-Rollout" Data Gap**
"Nicole, I saw the successful completion of the CargoWise global rollout in December—congratulations. Now that the core is live, many logistics leaders we work with face a 'data paralysis' where the new system holds the data, but client-facing dashboards (like Visiotrack) lag behind. How are you handling the real-time API sync between CargoWise NEO and your client portals?"

**Starter 2: The CSRD Compliance Hurdle**
"I read your 2024 Sustainability Report and noticed the focus on Scope 3 emissions. Aggregating that subcontractor data is usually a manual nightmare. Localhost has deployed automated ETL pipelines for logistics firms that ingest subcontractor PDFs/Excels and feed clean data directly into Power BI, automating your CSRD reporting. Is this a bottleneck for your team right now?"

**Starter 3: Predictive vs. Reactive**
"Mario, your marketing for Visiotrack mentions predictive analysis. Are you currently using static rules-based alerts, or have you integrated ML models to predict port congestion? We can help you upgrade Visiotrack from 'tracking' to 'forecasting' using your historical shipment data."
