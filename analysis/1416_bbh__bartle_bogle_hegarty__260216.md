## 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX
**[Strategy]: Publicis CoreAI Implementation**
*   **The Evidence:** As a Publicis Groupe agency, BBH is integrating the **€300M "CoreAI" platform** (launched 2024/25) to automate creative production and personalization. They are actively using tools like Midjourney and Pika.AI in workflows.

*   **Localhost Service Map:** **AI & ML**

**[Hiring]: Creative Technologists (Full Stack)**
*   **The Evidence:** Job listings for "Creative Technologist" require "Full-Stack Web Development" skills including **React, Serverless architecture (Lambda, Netlify), and AWS**.
*   **The Source:** [If You Could Jobs - Creative Technologist](https://ifyoucouldjobs.com/jobs) (Archived/Recent)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Software Engineering**

**[Project]: Tesco "ICONS" Digital & OOH**
*   **The Evidence:** BBH executed the high-profile Tesco "ICONS" campaign (replacing logos with food). While OOH led, these campaigns increasingly require **digital asset management (DAM)** and programmatic delivery at scale.

**[Innovation]: Hardware & IoT Prototyping**
*   **The Evidence:** Engineering roles at BBH explicitly mention "PCB Prototyping / Hardware" and experience with **Unity/Unreal Engine** for AR/VR experiences.

## 3. SERVICES & STACK INTERSECTION
**Comparison of BBH Stack vs. Localhost Official Services**

✅ **The Sweet Spot (Direct Service Matches):**
*   **Software Engineering:** BBH hires "Creative Technologists" who are essentially Full Stack Engineers (React/Node).
    *   *Why it fits:* Agencies often have fluctuating demand. When they win a big digital campaign (e.g., for Samsung), they need immediate engineering capacity to build the web experience.
    *   *Tech Validation:* Their stack includes **AWS Lambda** and **Netlify**, perfectly aligning with modern web dev.
*   **AI & ML:** They are mandated to use **CoreAI**.
    *   *Why it fits:* While they have the *platform*, they likely need engineers to build custom *agents* or *connectors* for specific client data (e.g., connecting Tesco's loyalty data to CoreAI for personalized ads).

⚠️ **The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent/Upsell):**
*   **Cloud Services (FinOps):**
    *   *The Angle:* They use AWS and Serverless for campaigns. Campaign traffic is "spiky" (huge bursts then zero). We can offer **Cloud Cost Optimization** to ensure they aren't overpaying for idle resources between campaigns.
*   **Platform Development:**
    *   *The Angle:* They build "experiences." We can pitch converting these one-off experiences into reusable **Microservices** or a "Campaign-as-a-Service" platform to reduce their time-to-market for future clients.

❌ **The Mismatch (Out of Scope):**
*   **Legacy Modernization (Mainframe/ERP):**
    *   *Reason:* BBH is a creative shop. They do not manage deep legacy banking backends or SAP migrations. That is the domain of Publicis Sapient, not BBH.

## 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE
**Conversation Starters based on Business Needs**

**Starter 1: The "CoreAI" Operational Gap**
"I've been following the Publicis CoreAI rollout—it's a massive competitive advantage. However, many agencies we work with struggle to bridge the gap between the *platform* and the *client's specific data*. Localhost's AI engineers can build the custom 'Connectors' you need to securely pipe client data (like Tesco's Clubcard stats) into your generative workflows."

**Starter 2: The "Campaign Spike" Challenge**
"Your 'Creative Technologist' roles mention heavy use of AWS Lambda and Serverless. We often see agencies over-provisioning cloud resources for campaign launches to avoid crashes, leading to wasted budget. Our Cloud team specializes in 'Burst Scaling' architectures that handle the Super Bowl-level traffic without the dormant costs afterwards."

**Starter 3: Production Scalability (Outsourcing)**
"You sell world-class ideas, but building the digital assets for a global rollout (e.g., Samsung) creates a massive engineering bottleneck. Instead of hiring permanent full-stack devs for temporary campaigns, Localhost can serve as your 'White Label Production Engine,' handling the React/Node builds while your Creative Technologists focus on the innovation."
