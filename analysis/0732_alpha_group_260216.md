## 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX
**[M&A Integration]: Cobase Acquisition & Scaling**
*   **The Evidence:** Alpha acquired Cobase (Treasury Management) in Dec 2023. In 2025, the focus is on "scaling the business even further" and integrating Cobase's multi-bank connectivity with Alpha's FX platform.
*   **The Source:** [Alpha Group FY24 Trading Update](https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/ALPH/trading-update/16298543)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Platform Development** (API Integration/Microservices)

**[Expansion]: Global Office Growth (60% YoY)**
*   **The Evidence:** Overseas offices grew revenue by nearly 60% in 2024. This rapid geographic expansion (Madrid, etc.) creates immediate needs for standardized cloud infrastructure and security compliance across jurisdictions.
*   **The Source:** [Alpha Group Annual Report 2024](https://www.alphagroup.com/investors/)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Cloud Services** (Infrastructure Standardization)

**[Product]: Alternative Banking Platform**
*   **The Evidence:** The "Alternative Banking" division grew revenue by 20% with account numbers surpassing 7,100. They are explicitly building a "Bank-Agnostic" platform requiring robust API orchestration.
*   **The Source:** [Alpha Group Solutions: Alternative Banking](https://www.alphagroup.com/solutions/alternative-banking/)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Software Engineering** (FinTech App Dev)

**[Tech Stack]: ERP & Treasury Connectivity**
*   **The Evidence:** The Cobase platform relies on "pre-built connectors" to NetSuite, SAP, and Oracle. Maintaining and expanding this library of connectors is a continuous engineering burden.

## 3. SERVICES & STACK INTERSECTION
Comparison of **Alpha Group** Stack vs. Localhost Official Services.

✅ **The Sweet Spot (Direct Service Matches):**
*   **Platform Development:** Alpha is merging two distinct platforms (Alpha FX + Cobase).
    *   *Why it fits:* They need to unify the UX and backend APIs so a client can see FX risk and Treasury Cash Management in a single pane of glass.
    *   *Tech Validation:* Use of **APIs**, **SWIFT**, and **Bank Connectivity** protocols.
*   **Software Engineering:** Custom connector development for ERPs.
    *   *Why it fits:* Cobase's value prop is "plug-and-play" with NetSuite/SAP. They need constant engineering resources to build and maintain these integrations as ERP versions update.

⚠️ **The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent/Upsell):**
*   **Data & Analytic Services:** Consolidated Treasury Reporting.
    *   *The Angle:* Clients using both Alpha and Cobase generate massive financial datasets. Localhost can build a **Data Warehouse** layer to offer clients "Predictive Cash Flow" analytics, moving beyond simple reporting.
*   **DevOps & Cybersecurity:** Multi-Jurisdiction Compliance.
    *   *The Angle:* As they expand into new regions (e.g., Madrid, Canada), data sovereignty rules change. We can offer **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** to deploy compliant regional instances of their platform instantly.

❌ **The Mismatch (Out of Scope):**
*   **Mainframe Maintenance:**
    *   *Reason:* Alpha is a "Cloud-Native" FinTech challenger, not a legacy bank. They do not have legacy COBOL cores to maintain.

## 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE
**Starter 1: The Integration Friction (Cobase)**
"I reviewed your FY24 growth, particularly the success of the Cobase acquisition. Typically, the post-acquisition technical challenge is unifying the API surface area so clients don't feel like they are using two different tools. Localhost's **Platform Engineering** team specializes in abstracting these complex multi-bank integrations into a single microservices layer."

**Starter 2: The ERP Connector Bottleneck**
"With your Alternative Banking platform scaling to 7,100+ accounts, the demand for real-time ERP reconciliation (NetSuite/SAP) usually outpaces internal engineering capacity. We have a dedicated **Software Engineering** pod that can take over the maintenance of your 3rd-party connector library, allowing your core team to focus on the FX algorithm."

**Starter 3: Global Compliance Scaling**
"Seeing your 60% growth in overseas offices, maintaining consistent security posture across fragmented jurisdictions is often a headache. We can implement a **DevOps** 'Region-in-a-Box' strategy using Infrastructure as Code, ensuring every new office launch is compliant by default."
