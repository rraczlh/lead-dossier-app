## 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX
**Type: Strategic Capital Injection**
**The Evidence:** Secured **€30 Million** in June 2024 specifically to "scale up and accelerate the expansion of manufacturing operations" and enhance capacity for Hydrogen/CCUS applications.
**The Source:** [Renewables Now - Strohm Raises €30M](https://renewablesnow.com/news/hydrogen-pipeline-maker-strohm-raises-eur-30m-in-new-funds-860058/)
**Localhost Service Map:** **IoT & Process Automation**

**Type: Job Signal (Technical)**
**The Evidence:** Hiring a **Maintenance Engineer** (2024/2025) requiring experience with **ERP systems (SAP, Ultimo, Maximo)** and the ability to "connect data with practical experience" for asset management.
**The Source:** [Strohm Careers - Maintenance Engineer](https://strohm.eu/careers)
**Localhost Service Map:** **Data & Analytic Services**

**Type: Commercial Contract (Scale Signal)**
**The Evidence:** Awarded largest commercial contract in history by **TotalEnergies** (July 2024) for ultra-deepwater CO2 pipelines, requiring rigorous quality tracking and likely **Digital Twin** integration for integrity monitoring.

## 3. SERVICES & STACK INTERSECTION
**Comparison of Strohm Stack vs. Localhost Official Services**

✅ **The Sweet Spot (Direct Service Matches):**
*   **IoT & Process Automation:** Strohm is physically tripling manufacturing capacity. They explicitly mention "Digital Automated Manufacturing."
    *   *Why it fits:* The €30M raise is earmarked for *factory expansion*. This requires SCADA integration, sensor data collection, and hardware-software bridging.
    *   *Tech Validation:* Confirmed interest in **Industrial Automation** and **PLC** systems.
*   **Data & Analytic Services:** The shift to "Energy Transition" (Hydrogen/CO2) requires precise data on pipe integrity (permeability, corrosion).
    *   *Why it fits:* Job posts ask for engineers who can "connect data with practical experience" and use **SAP/Maximo**. They need to move from legacy ERP data to predictive analytics.

⚠️ **The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent/Upsell):**
*   **AI & ML (Digital Twin):**
    *   *The Angle:* They are selling "Composite Pipes" for 30-year lifecycles in deep water. A **Digital Twin** service sold alongside the physical pipe (to monitor stress/fatigue via embedded sensors) is the logical next revenue stream.
    *   *The Angle:* Use GenAI to automate the generation of compliance documentation for their new "CO2 compatible" product lines, which face heavy regulatory scrutiny.
*   **Cloud Services (Migration):**
    *   *The Angle:* As they scale globally (Brazil, US, Malaysia), on-premise ERPs (like legacy SAP) will become a bottleneck. Pitch a **Cloud-Native Migration** for their supply chain data to ensure real-time visibility for clients like TotalEnergies.

❌ **The Mismatch (Out of Scope):**
*   **Consumer Mobile Apps:**
    *   *Reason:* Strohm is a B2B heavy industrial manufacturer. They do not need consumer-facing iOS/Android apps, only potentially ruggedized field service apps (which falls under Enterprise Software).

## 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE
**Starter 1: The "Scale-Up" Trigger**
"Henk, I saw the news about the €30M raise and the TotalEnergies contract—congratulations. With that level of manufacturing expansion in IJmuiden, are you finding that your current **ERP and Data infrastructure** can keep up with the tripled production volume, or is data visibility becoming a bottleneck?"

**Starter 2: The "Digital Twin" Angle**
"With your push into CO2 and Hydrogen transport, asset integrity is going to be under the microscope. We've helped manufacturing clients build **predictive data models** that act as a 'Digital Twin' for critical infrastructure—allowing you to sell not just a pipe, but a 30-year guarantee backed by real-time data."

**Starter 3: The "OT/IT" Convergence**
"Scaling from a specialized workshop to a global mass-manufacturer often breaks legacy IT systems. I noticed you're hiring for Maintenance Engineers with SAP experience—Localhost can help you architect a **middleware layer** that connects your new automated manufacturing floor directly to your ERP, eliminating manual data entry."
