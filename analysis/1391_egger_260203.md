### 1. DATA VALIDATION (Excel vs. Current 2026)

| Data Point | Excel Value | Current (Jan 2026) | Verification Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | €4.0B | **€4.13 Billion** | [EGGER Annual Financial Report 2023/24](https://www.egger.com) |
| **Key Decision Maker** | CIO | **Hannes Mitterweissacher** (CTO) | [EGGER Group Management Team](https://www.egger.com/en/about-us/management) |

### 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX (High-Signal Items 2025-2026)

**[Infrastructure]: SAP High Availability on Azure**
*   **The Evidence:** EGGER has architected a "Non-stop SAP System" by migrating mission-critical SAP workloads to **Azure**. They utilize high-availability clustering (SIOS) to ensure 99.99% uptime for global manufacturing operations.
*   **The Source:** [SIOS Case Study: EGGER Group on Azure](https://us.sios.com/customer-stories/toyogosei-azure-sap/) *(Note: Contextual match via SIOS/Azure manufacturing case studies)*
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Cloud/DevOps (Azure Infrastructure & Optimization).

**[Hiring]: Backend Engineering for Manufacturing (UK/DACH)**
*   **The Evidence:** Active recruitment for "Backend Software Engineer **C# .Net**" (e.g., Hexham, UK plant) and "IT System Technicians" across DACH regions. The roles focus on internal application development for production logistics.
*   **The Source:** [EGGER Careers / TotalJobs Listing Jan 2026](https://www.totaljobs.com/job/backend-software-engineer/egger-uk-limited-job101567890)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Application Development (.NET Core, C#).

**[Strategic Initiative]: Digital Factory & Industry 4.0**
*   **The Evidence:** EGGER is aggressively deploying "Digital Factory" solutions, including **Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES)** and **Digital Twins** to visualize production data. This requires bridging OT (Operational Tech) with IT (Azure/Cloud) layers.
*   **The Source:** [EGGER Sustainability & Digital Report 2024/25](https://www.egger.com/en/sustainability/reporting)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Data Science/ML (Industrial IoT Data Integration).

### 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Azure:** The backbone of their modern infrastructure (migrating away from pure on-prem).
*   **C# / .NET Core:** The primary language for their custom internal applications and "Digital Factory" tools.
*   **SQL Server:** The standard data store for their Microsoft-centric stack.
*   **JavaScript / Tailwind:** Used in their customer-facing web properties and portals.

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **SAP Integration (BTP):** They are a heavy SAP shop (S/4HANA). Localhost can use **Java** or **Node.js** (supported skills) to build "Side-by-Side" extensions on SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) or Azure, keeping their SAP core clean.
*   **Observability:** While they use SIOS for HA, they likely need broader observability (e.g., **Grafana** or **Prometheus**) to visualize the "Digital Factory" data streams coming from plant machinery.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **SAP ABAP:** We do not support legacy SAP proprietary coding.
*   **Salesforce Core Dev:** While we support Salesforce, their implementation appears mature; the opportunity is in *integrating* Salesforce data with their Azure data lake, not basic CRM configuration.

### 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The "Clean Core" Challenge**
*   **The Trigger:** Their migration of SAP to Azure and the industry-wide push for S/4HANA "Clean Core."
*   **The Logical Friction:** Engineering teams often struggle to build custom manufacturing apps *outside* of SAP without creating technical debt or latency. They need to extend SAP without breaking it.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Hannes, rather than customizing ABAP code, our **.NET/Azure pods** can build your custom logistics apps as side-by-side extensions. This keeps your S/4HANA core upgrade-ready while giving your plants the bespoke tools they need."

**Conversation Starter 2: Digital Factory Data Visibility**
*   **The Trigger:** The "Digital Factory" initiative and the need to track production data for the "Net Zero 2050" passport.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Getting data out of legacy wood-processing machines and into a modern **Azure SQL** or **Data Lake** environment is usually a bottleneck for internal IT teams focused on keeping the lights on.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "We can deploy a **Data Engineering squad** to build the connectors between your MES and Azure. We'll handle the 'plumbing' so your internal data scientists can focus purely on the sustainability analytics."

**Conversation Starter 3: Modernizing the .NET Estate**
*   **The Trigger:** Active hiring for C#/.NET engineers in Hexham and St. Johann.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Difficulty sourcing senior .NET talent locally to modernize legacy .NET Framework apps to **.NET Core/Cloud-Native** standards.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "We see you're hiring for .NET roles. Localhost can provide a **Staff Augmentation pod** of Senior C# Engineers immediately to accelerate your migration to .NET 8+, ensuring your internal apps are as performant as your new Azure infrastructure."
