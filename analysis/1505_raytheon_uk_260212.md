### 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX

**[Contract]: Space Domain Awareness (SDA) Expansion**
*   **The Evidence:** Raytheon UK secured a contract in Nov 2025 to provide orbital analysts and their proprietary "NORSSTrack" software to the UK Space Agency. The role requires handling "large-scale data processing systems" and "cloud-native engineering."
*   **The Source:** [Airforce Technology: Raytheon UK wins contract for space awareness (Nov 2025)](https://www.airforce-technology.com/news/raytheon-uk-wins-contract-to-provide-analysts-for-space-awareness/)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Data Engineering & AI (Spark/Kafka/Python)

**[Hiring]: OMNIA Training Transformation**
*   **The Evidence:** Active recruitment for "Software Developers" to support the OMNIA program (transforming British Army training). The stack is explicitly **Node.js, Python, Java, React, and AWS/Azure** with a focus on "integrating legacy systems" and "microservices."
*   **The Source:** [Raytheon Careers: Software Developer - Warminster (Jan 2026)](https://jobs.rtx.com/job/warminster/software-developer/4679/3329952)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Application Development (Modernization Squads)

**[Expansion]: National Security Cyber (Gloucester/Manchester)**
*   **The Evidence:** The Cyber division is hiring "Senior Software Engineers" for DevSecOps at scale. They require **Go (Golang), React, Next.js, Docker, and Kubernetes** to build "high-assurance software" for intelligence sectors.
*   **The Source:** [Hackajob/Raytheon Cyber Profile (2025)](https://hackajob.com/companies/raytheon-uk)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** DevOps & Infra (Kubernetes/OpenShift)

**[R&D]: Digital Twinning & Synthetic Environments**
*   **The Evidence:** CEO James Gray confirmed (Sept 2025) a heavy investment in "Digital Twinning" for weapons integration to accelerate product qualification. This requires high-performance computing and simulation (C++/C#).
*   **The Source:** [Raytheon UK CEO Interview at DSEI 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex-LUjJom8B)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Software Engineering (C++/C#)

**[Infrastructure]: Multi-Cloud Adoption (AWS + Azure)**
*   **The Evidence:** Job listings confirm a "Cloud First" mindset utilizing both **AWS and Azure**, along with **Terraform** for IaC. They are specifically looking for engineers to "migrate legacy systems" to these platforms.
*   **The Source:** [Haystack: Raytheon UK Tech Stack Profile](https://haystackapp.io/companies/raytheon-uk)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Cloud Platforms (Migration & Optimization)

### 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Backend:** Java, Python, C#, Node.js, Go (Golang).
*   **Frontend:** React, Next.js, Angular.
*   **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Jenkins, GitHub Actions.
*   **Data:** PostgreSQL, Apache Kafka, Elasticsearch.
*   *Source:* [Raytheon UK Careers & Tech Profiles 2025-2026](https://jobs.rtx.com)

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **OpenShift:** They use Red Hat OpenShift (managed Kubernetes). Localhost lists "OpenShift" in the matrix, making this a prime area for specialized container orchestration support.
*   **Tekton:** They mention Tekton for CI/CD pipelines. Localhost supports standard CI/CD (Jenkins/GitLab), offering an opportunity to help migrate or manage these complex pipelines.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **Embedded Real-Time OS:** They rely heavily on **VxWorks** and **Lua** for weapon systems (High Energy Laser, etc.). Localhost does not support embedded RTOS or Lua.
*   **Legacy Simulation:** Usage of proprietary "ABACUS" simulation software.

### 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The OMNIA Modernization Velocity**
*   **The Trigger:** Their massive "OMNIA" contract to digitize British Army training requires shifting legacy simulation systems to a modern cloud-native architecture (Node.js/React/AWS).
*   **The Logical Friction:** Migrating mission-critical training data from on-prem legacy hardware to the cloud without disrupting active training cycles is historically slow and prone to "technical debt" accumulation.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** Localhost’s **Application Modernization Squads** can handle the non-classified "outer loop" development (Frontend dashboards in React, API gateways in Node.js), freeing their cleared engineers to focus on the core simulation engines.

**Conversation Starter 2: Space Domain Data Pipelines**
*   **The Trigger:** The Nov 2025 "Space Domain Awareness" contract relies on the "NORSSTrack" software, which processes massive streams of orbital data.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Ingesting and processing real-time satellite telemetry requires highly optimized data pipelines (Kafka/Spark) that often bottleneck as sensor inputs increase.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** Localhost’s **Data Engineering** experts can optimize their Apache Kafka/Spark ingestion layers, ensuring NORSSTrack scales efficiently as they add more orbital analysts to the High Wycombe center.

**Conversation Starter 3: DevSecOps Standardization**
*   **The Trigger:** Their Cyber division in Gloucester is hiring for a mix of Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Tekton, indicating a potentially fragmented CI/CD landscape across different projects.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Managing disparate CI/CD tools across "High Assurance" projects increases security surface area and slows down deployment frequency.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** Localhost can deploy a **DevOps Standardization Pod** to unify their pipelines using Terraform and Azure DevOps/GitHub Actions, reducing build times and simplifying their compliance audit trails.
