### 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX

**[Expansion]: The "AI Forge" Initiative**
*   **The Evidence:** CHECK24 has established a dedicated unit called "AI Forge" specifically to integrate LLMs and GenAI into their comparison products. They are actively hiring "Team Leads" and "Senior Data Scientists" with Python/FastAPI/LLM stacks to build "productive AI solutions" rather than just PoCs.

*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Data Science & ML (Generative AI, Python, FastAPI)

**[Strategy]: The "Native-Only" Mobile Decree**
*   **The Evidence:** Their engineering career page explicitly states: *"Develop native apps for iOS and Android - we don't think much of hybrid apps."* This is a rare, hard-line stance against React Native/Flutter for their core comparison products, creating a permanent need for pure Swift and Kotlin specialists.
*   **The Source:** [CHECK24 Careers: App Development Philosophy](https://jobs.check24.de/en/software-engineering)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Application Development (Mobile: Swift, Kotlin)

**[Modernization]: C24 Bank Fintech Stack**
*   **The Evidence:** The "C24 Bank" subsidiary operates on a distinct, modern tech stack compared to the legacy PHP portal. They are hiring for Java/Spring Boot and Kotlin roles to support features like "Pockets," "Real-time transfers," and "Multi-banking," moving away from the monolith.
*   **The Source:** [C24 Bank Product Page & Features](https://www.c24.de/funktionen)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Application Development (Backend: Java, Spring)

**[Infrastructure]: Cloud-Native Standardization**
*   **The Evidence:** Job postings for "System Administration" and "DevOps" highlight a shift toward "Infrastructure as Code" using Ansible, Puppet, and Docker/Kubernetes on AWS, specifically to support their decentralized "Pod" structure (Travel, Insurance, Shopping verticals).
*   **The Source:** [CHECK24 Tech Stack & Jobs](https://jobs.check24.de/en/software-engineering)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Cloud & DevOps (AWS, Kubernetes, Docker)

### 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Backend:** **Java (Spring Boot)** and **Node.js** are heavily used in their modern verticals (C24 Bank, Shopping), aligning perfectly with Localhost's core backend services.
*   **Frontend:** **React** and **TypeScript** are the standard for their web frontends, replacing legacy jQuery/Angular.
*   **Mobile:** **Swift** and **Kotlin** are mandatory due to their "No Hybrid" policy.
*   **AI/Data:** **Python**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, and **FastAPI** are the confirmed stack for their "AI Forge".

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **PHP (Symfony):** A significant portion of their legacy comparison portal still runs on PHP. While Localhost lists PHP, the opportunity here is likely **Migration** (PHP -> Node.js/Java) or maintaining legacy systems while their internal teams focus on the new stack.
*   **Infrastructure Automation:** They use **Puppet/Ansible**. Localhost specializes in **CDK/CloudFormation**. This presents an opportunity to modernize their IaC practices as they scale further into AWS.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **Hybrid Mobile Frameworks:** They explicitly reject **React Native** and **Flutter** for core apps. Pitching these would be a strategic error; strictly pitch Native.
*   **Microsoft Stack (Limited):** While they use C#/.NET Core in some insurance verticals, the dominant signal is Linux/Java/PHP.

### 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE

**Conversation Starter 1: The "AI Forge" Acceleration**
*   **The Trigger:** Their specific recruitment for the "AI Forge" unit to build *productive* LLM features (not just R&D).
*   **The Logical Friction:** Scaling a centralized AI team to serve dozens of distinct verticals (Travel, Insurance, Energy) creates a bottleneck. They likely have a backlog of vertical-specific AI requests (e.g., "Insurance Policy Summarizer") that the core team can't ship fast enough.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** Localhost can deploy **"AI Feature Pods"** (Python/Langchain engineers) that sit *within* the specific verticals (e.g., Travel) but adhere to the AI Forge's architectural standards, clearing the backlog without bloating the central headcount.

**Conversation Starter 2: The "Native-Only" Mobile Challenge**
*   **The Trigger:** Their public "Anti-Hybrid" stance ("We don't think much of hybrid apps").
*   **The Logical Friction:** Maintaining two distinct codebases (Swift & Kotlin) for every single feature update doubles the engineering effort and often leads to feature parity issues between iOS and Android versions.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** Localhost provides **synchronized Native Mobile Squads**—pairs of Senior Swift and Kotlin developers who work in tandem. We don't try to sell you React Native; we give you the velocity of a hybrid team with the quality of the native code you demand.

**Conversation Starter 3: C24 Bank Modernization**
*   **The Trigger:** The rapid growth of C24 Bank and its integration with the legacy comparison portal.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Financial data consistency between the modern Java/Spring banking stack and the legacy PHP comparison engine is likely a massive integration headache, requiring complex APIs and data synchronization.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** Localhost's **Backend Modernization Engineers** (Java + PHP background) can act as the "glue" team, building the robust APIs and microservices needed to decouple the C24 Bank from the legacy portal, ensuring regulatory compliance and speed.
