### 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX (High-Signal Items)

**[Partnership]: AI-Driven Network Assurance**
*   **The Evidence:** In November 2025, 1GLOBAL partnered with RADCOM to deploy "AI-driven assurance" across their global network to monitor customer experience and service quality.
*   **The Source:** [TelecomLead / PR Newswire (Nov 2025)](https://www.telecomlead.com)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** **Data Science & ML (Core)** – Integrating RADCOM's data streams requires robust data pipelines (Pandas/Polars) and custom dashboards (Grafana/React).

**[Cloud Modernization]: Compliance Platform Migration**
*   **The Evidence:** 1GLOBAL explicitly reported the completion of migrating its "on-premises recording solution" (legacy Truphone) to a "cloud-based platform" in 2024/2025 to serve Tier 1 banks.
*   **The Source:** [TP Global Operations Strategic Report 2024](https://www.1global.com)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** **Cloud DevOps (AWS/Kubernetes)** – ongoing optimization and Day-2 operations for this critical financial compliance infrastructure.

**[Product Expansion]: API-First Fintech Integration**
*   **The Evidence:** 1GLOBAL is aggressively expanding its "Connect API" usage, recently powering eSIM services for **Revolut** (40M users) and **N26** (Germany).
*   **The Source:** [1GLOBAL Press Release / Connect Web (May 2025)](https://www.1global.com)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** **Application Development (Backend/Node.js)** – High-performance API engineering is required to handle the burst traffic from millions of banking app users.

**[Hiring]: Cloud & Platform Engineering**
*   **The Evidence:** Job listings for "Solutions Engineer" and "Platform Developer" emphasize proficiency in **Python, Go, AWS, and Kubernetes**.
*   **The Source:** [Remote Rocketship / Indeed (Jan 2026)](https://remoterocketship.com)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** **Staff Augmentation (Go/Python)** – Direct skill match for their platform engineering teams.

### 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Languages:** **Java** (Legacy Core), **Go** (Modern Telco Stack), **Node.js** (API Layer), **Python** (Data/Scripting).
*   **Cloud & DevOps:** **AWS** (Primary Provider), **Kubernetes** (Container Orchestration), **Docker**.
*   **Frontend:** **React** (Customer Portals & Dashboards).

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **Observability:** They are using **RADCOM** (External Vendor). *Opportunity:* Localhost can build custom **Grafana** dashboards that aggregate RADCOM data with internal AWS CloudWatch metrics for a "Single Pane of Glass" view.
*   **Security:** They use **Nessus**. *Opportunity:* Integrate automated security scanning into **GitHub Actions** pipelines (DevSecOps) to shift security left.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **Telecom Core:** Specific SS7/Diameter signaling protocols or GSMA-certified SM-DP+ servers (specialized telco hardware/software) are outside Localhost's IT-focused matrix.

### 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The "Day 2" Cloud Challenge**
*   **The Trigger:** The recent completion of the "Compliance Recording" migration from on-prem to cloud.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Migrating is step one; optimizing costs and ensuring 99.999% availability for Tier 1 banks (who demand strict compliance) is step two. They likely face "cloud sprawl" or latency issues in specific POPs.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Mikael, now that the Compliance platform is cloud-native, our **AWS Optimization Squads** can audit the infrastructure to reduce egress costs and implement **Kubernetes** auto-scaling that actually responds to banking traffic spikes."

**Conversation Starter 2: Scaling the API Economy**
*   **The Trigger:** The massive volume influx from the **Revolut** and **N26** partnerships (40M+ potential users hitting their APIs).
*   **The Logical Friction:** API rate limiting, latency during travel peak seasons, and maintaining developer documentation for new fintech partners.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "With the Revolut integration ramping up, we can deploy a **Node.js/Go backend pod** to specifically refactor your 'Connect API' middleware, ensuring sub-100ms response times for eSIM provisioning globally."

**Conversation Starter 3: Operationalizing AI Assurance**
*   **The Trigger:** The **RADCOM** partnership for AI-driven assurance.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Buying an AI tool is easy; integrating its insights into daily engineering workflows is hard. Engineers often ignore alerts if they aren't contextualized.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "We see you've brought in RADCOM for network AI. Localhost's **Data Engineering team** can build the 'Last Mile' integration—piping those anomalies directly into **ServiceNow** or **Slack** via Python wrappers so your NOC team reacts instantly."
