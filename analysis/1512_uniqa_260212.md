### 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX

**[Hiring]: Cloud & Java Engineering Expansion**
*   **The Evidence:** UNIQA Group Service Center (GSC) and UNIQA Software Services are actively hiring "Java Developers" and "Solution Architects" to support their centralized IT strategy. The roles emphasize modernizing core insurance platforms using Java Spring Boot and Cloud-native architectures.
*   **The Source:** [UNIQA GSC Careers - Java Developer & Solution Architect](https://www.uniqa-gsc.sk/career)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** Java, Spring Boot, Azure, Kubernetes

**[Strategic]: "Mavie" Digital Health Ecosystem**
*   **The Evidence:** Under the "UNIQA 3.0" strategy, the company is aggressively expanding "Mavie" (formerly SanusX), a digital health ecosystem. This operates as a corporate startup requiring rapid feature iteration, distinct from the slower core IT, and has recently received external investment from Raiffeisen.
*   **The Source:** [Mavie Next / UNIQA Group Report](https://www.uniqagroup.com/gruppe/versicherung/uniqa-group/what-we-want-to-be/mavie.en.html)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** React, Next.js, Mobile Development (iOS/Android), Azure

**[Infrastructure]: Data Platform Modernization**
*   **The Evidence:** Wolf-Christoph Gerlach’s mandate explicitly covers "Operations, Data & IT". The group is consolidating data silos from CEE subsidiaries (15+ countries) into a central Azure-based data platform to support IFRS 17 reporting and personalized pricing.
*   **The Source:** [UNIQA Management Board Responsibilities](https://www.uniqagroup.com/gruppe/versicherung/investor-relations/corporate-governance/management-board/wolf_gerlach.en.html)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** Azure, Databricks, Python, Data Engineering

**[Core Systems]: Guidewire & SAP Integration**
*   **The Evidence:** UNIQA relies on Guidewire for core insurance processes and SAP for finance. The integration of these monolithic systems with their new digital front-ends (Angular) creates a constant demand for middleware and API integration engineers.
*   **The Source:** [UNIQA Software Services Profile](https://www.mingle.ro/company/uniqa-software-services)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** REST API, Java, Integration Services

### 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Java & Spring Boot:** The backbone of their custom insurance applications.
*   **Azure:** Their primary cloud provider for the "UNIQA 3.0" transformation.
*   **Angular:** Used for customer-facing web portals.
*   **Kubernetes:** Mentioned in Solution Architect roles for container orchestration.

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **Guidewire:** They use this heavily. While we don't implement Guidewire, we can handle the **Java-based integration layers** and **API connectors** that link Guidewire to their digital apps.
*   **Mavie Health Tech:** This unit likely uses **React/React Native** (common in health-tech startups) which aligns with our frontend capabilities, even if their core IT prefers Angular.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **Mainframe Legacy:** Any remaining COBOL/Mainframe maintenance for Austrian legacy policies is outside our scope.
*   **SAP Core:** We do not offer functional SAP ERP consulting.

### 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The "Mavie" Velocity Gap**
*   **The Trigger:** The aggressive expansion of the *Mavie* health ecosystem and the recent Raiffeisen investment.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Corporate IT structures (optimized for stability/Guidewire) often struggle to match the release velocity required by a digital health startup like Mavie. They likely face bottlenecks in mobile/web feature delivery.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** Propose a **"Digital Acceleration Pod"** specifically for Mavie. We provide ready-to-deploy React/Mobile squads that work in agile sprints, bypassing the heavier core IT processes while ensuring security compliance.

**Conversation Starter 2: The CEE Data Unification**
*   **The Trigger:** Wolf-Christoph Gerlach’s focus on "Data & IT" across 15 CEE countries.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Centralizing data from diverse subsidiaries (with different legacy systems) into a single Azure Data Lake is notoriously difficult. Data quality and pipeline reliability are likely causing delays in their AI/Pricing initiatives.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** Position our **Data Engineering Services (Python/Databricks)**. We don't just build pipelines; we build "Data Products" that allow their CEE subsidiaries to consume clean data immediately, accelerating their IFRS 17 and BI reporting.

**Conversation Starter 3: The "Java Modernization" Talent Crunch**
*   **The Trigger:** Active hiring for Java Developers and Solution Architects at UNIQA GSC.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Finding senior Java talent capable of breaking down monoliths into Microservices (Spring Boot/Kubernetes) is difficult in the DACH/CEE region due to high competition.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** Offer **Staff Augmentation for Core Modernization**. We can inject Senior Java Engineers who are experts in Microservices patterns to work alongside their internal teams, ensuring knowledge transfer while speeding up the decoupling of their legacy core.
