1. DATA VALIDATION (Excel vs. Current 2026)

| Data Point | Excel Value | Current (Jan 2026) | Verification Source (Title/Link) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | $1,000M | **$641M** (Brokerage Revenue) | [Business Insurance Top 100 Brokers 2025](https://www.businessinsurance.com/) |
| **Key Decision Maker** | CIO | **Bert Hardy** (CIO) | [Hilb Group Leadership Team](https://www.hilbgroup.com/about-us/leadership-team/) |

*Note: The $1B figure in your Excel likely refers to Gross Written Premium (GWP) or Enterprise Value. The $641M figure is the verified brokerage revenue, which is the more accurate metric for IT budget estimation.*

2. THE EVIDENCE BOX (High-Signal Items 2025-2026)

**[Strategic]: The "Roll-Up" Data Fragmentation**
*   **The Evidence:** Hilb Group has completed over **190 acquisitions** (including recent 2025 deals in PA and NJ). They explicitly list "SVP, Business Analytics" (Robin Reinarz) as a key leadership role, indicating a centralized data strategy is in place but likely under pressure from constant intake of new, disparate data sources.
*   **The Source:** [Hilb Group Growth & Acquisitions](https://www.hilbgroup.com/about-us/)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** **Data Engineering (Python/SQL)** to automate the ETL process of ingesting acquired agency data into a central Azure Data Lake.

**[Hiring]: Implementation Bottlenecks**
*   **The Evidence:** Active recruitment for "Implementation Specialists" (Remote) to onboard clients onto benefits platforms like Employee Navigator and Ease. This suggests a manual, high-friction onboarding process that scales linearly with headcount rather than software.
*   **The Source:** [Remote Rocketship / Indeed Job Aggregations (Jan 2026)](https://remoterocketship.com)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** **Process Automation (Power Fx/Azure)** to build connectors that auto-provision client environments, reducing the need for manual "Implementation Specialist" labor.

**[Infrastructure]: The Azure Backbone**
*   **The Evidence:** Job descriptions for IT roles within the group and its subsidiaries consistently reference Microsoft ecosystems (Azure Stack HCI, SQL Server). As a Carlyle Group portfolio company, they are driven towards standardized, scalable enterprise infrastructure.
*   **The Source:** [Indeed / Glassdoor IT Listings](https://www.indeed.com)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** **Cloud Modernization (Azure)** to move acquired agencies from on-prem servers (common in small insurance agencies) to the corporate Azure tenant.

3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Azure:** The corporate standard for their infrastructure.
*   **SQL Server:** The likely backend for their agency management data warehousing.
*   **Python:** Essential for the "Business Analytics" team to perform predictive modeling on risk and retention.
*   **Salesforce:** Used for CRM and pipeline management across the fragmented sales teams.

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **Power BI:** They have a VP of Business Intelligence. While not explicitly in your "Core" list, it pairs perfectly with your **SQL/Python** capabilities for dashboarding.
*   **Power Automate (Power Fx):** They have manual "Implementation" workflows. You can pitch **Power Fx** to automate these.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **Vertafore / Applied Epic:** These are proprietary Insurance ERPs. We do not support these directly, but we *can* build the API layers that sit on top of them.

4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The "Acquisition Indigestion" Cure**
*   **The Trigger:** Their 190+ acquisition history and recent 2025 deals.
*   **The Logical Friction:** "Bert, with a new agency acquisition every month, your team is likely drowning in 'Data Indigestion'—spending more time cleaning CSV exports from legacy systems than building predictive models."
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Localhost can deploy a **Python/SQL Data Squad** to build a reusable 'Ingestion Engine.' We automate the dirty work of normalizing acquired data so your Business Analytics team (Robin’s group) gets clean data on Day 1, not Day 90."

**Conversation Starter 2: Scaling Onboarding without Headcount**
*   **The Trigger:** The active hiring of manual "Implementation Specialists."
*   **The Logical Friction:** "I see you're hiring folks just to configure Employee Navigator/Ease. That’s a linear cost that hurts EBITDA—exactly what Carlyle doesn't want."
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "We can build **Azure Logic Apps (or Power Automate)** connectors that auto-configure these platforms based on signed contracts. We turn a 2-week manual onboarding process into a 5-minute API call."

**Conversation Starter 3: The "Single Pane of Glass"**
*   **The Trigger:** The mix of Salesforce (Sales) and Vertafore (Operations).
*   **The Logical Friction:** "Your producers are likely swiveling between Salesforce to sell and Vertafore to service. That data gap means you're missing cross-sell opportunities."
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Localhost’s **Salesforce Developers** can build a bi-directional sync. We bring policy data *back* into Salesforce so your producers can see exactly when a client needs a renewal or a new line of coverage, without leaving their CRM."
