## 3. SERVICES & STACK INTERSECTION
Comparison of **Ocorian** Stack vs. Localhost Official Services.

✅ **The Sweet Spot (Direct Service Matches):**
*   **IoT & Process Automation:** Ocorian is aggressively moving away from "Outlook and Spreadsheets" (explicit quote) using **Next Matter**.
    *   *Why it fits:* They need to build custom connectors between Next Matter and their legacy core systems (ViewPoint/NavOne).
    *   *Tech Validation:* Their stack requires "bi-directional digital interfaces" (API integration).
*   **Data & Analytic Services:** The **AssetMetrix** partnership indicates a massive demand for consolidating fragmented data into a "Single Source of Truth."
    *   *Why it fits:* They are aggregating data from eFront, Yardi, and acquired entities. They need ETL pipelines to feed the AssetMetrix dashboard.

⚠️ **The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent/Upsell):**
*   **AI & ML (GenAI Agents):** They are already using OCR for invoices.
    *   *The Angle:* Pitch **GenAI Agents** for "Regulatory Document Review" (KYC/AML). Since they handle complex fund structures, a semantic search agent over their legal documents would be the next logical evolution from simple OCR.
*   **Cloud Services (Azure Migration):**
    *   *The Angle:* With the shift to SaaS partners (Next Matter/AssetMetrix), their remaining on-prem legacy data (ViewPoint) will create latency. Pitch a "Cloud-Native Wrapper" or migration strategy to ensure seamless integration with their new SaaS ecosystem.

❌ **The Mismatch (Out of Scope):**
*   **ERP Implementation (SAP/Oracle):**
    *   *Reason:* They are deeply committed to industry-specific ledgers like **Yardi** (Real Estate) and **eFront** (PE). We should not pitch replacing these core ledgers, but rather *integrating* with them.

## 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE
**Starter 1: The "Orchestration" Trigger (Focus: Arvinder Mudhar)**
"Arvinder, I saw the Nov '25 announcement regarding your mandate to drive automation. While **Next Matter** handles the workflow orchestration, many firms find the *last mile* of connecting those workflows to legacy systems like **ViewPoint** creates a new bottleneck. We specialize in building the API middleware that makes those 'human-in-the-loop' automations seamless."

**Starter 2: The "Data Unification" Trigger (Focus: Yegor Lanovenko)**
"Yegor, your vision for 'tech-enabled' fund services is clear with the **AssetMetrix** launch. However, the challenge we often see is that real-time reporting is only as good as the ETL pipelines feeding it. If you're facing latency in harmonizing data between **eFront** and your new analytics layer, our Data Engineering team can optimize those pipelines."

**Starter 3: The "Compliance Scale" Trigger (Focus: AI)**
"With the regulatory complexity in Jersey and Mauritius increasing, your team is likely drowning in document review despite your OCR tools. We are deploying **GenAI Agents** for financial clients that go beyond extraction—they perform 'semantic cross-checking' of KYC documents against internal risk policies, reducing manual compliance checks by 40%."
