### 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX
**1. ERP & BI Transformation (High Signal)**
*   **The Evidence:** Petainer executed a massive "five-country ERP transformational rollout" migrating from legacy Sage/QuickBooks to **Infor M3** (CloudSuite Food & Beverage) and **Power BI**. The project involved complex API integrations for Inventory, Fixed Assets, and AR/AP.
*   **The Source:** [Project Management Case Study / Resume Snippet](https://upstackhq.com/resume/program-manager-petainer-uk) (Cached)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** **Power BI** (Dashboards), **Azure** (Data Infrastructure), **Application Development** (API Integration).

**2. Manufacturing Data Integration (MES)**
*   **The Evidence:** The production floor utilizes **Includis MES** (Manufacturing Execution System) for real-time machine data collection. This system is integrated with the central ERP (Infor M3) to provide "fully transparent production processes."
*   **The Source:** [Includis Case Study / Integration Log](https://www.includis.com/en/references/) & [Petainer Technical Resume](https://upstackhq.com/resume/program-manager-petainer-uk)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** **Data Science/ML** (Predictive Maintenance), **Backend** (Data Lake Ingestion).

**3. Sustainability Data Reporting (SBTi)**
*   **The Evidence:** Petainer has committed to the **Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)**, requiring rigorous Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions reporting. Their 2024 ESG report highlights "improved data inputs" as a key operational focus to track recycled content (rPET) usage across global sites.
*   **The Source:** [Petainer 2024 ESG Report](https://www.petainer.com/sustainability/esg-report/)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** **Data Science** (Carbon Accounting Models), **Power BI** (ESG Dashboards).

**4. US Market Expansion (Tennessee)**
*   **The Evidence:** Petainer opened a new manufacturing site in Tennessee (Mount Pleasant) to serve the Americas, requiring new IT infrastructure and "Oversight of QuickBooks mapping onto the ERP" for local operations.
*   **The Source:** [Petainer News: American Made PET](https://www.petainer.com/news/) & Job Listings (Controller).
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** **Cloud DevOps** (Infrastructure scaling), **Support Pods** (US Timezone coverage).

### 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION
**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Power BI:** The core visualization layer for their new ERP and ESG reporting.
*   **Azure:** The likely identity and data backbone for their Power BI implementation.
*   **AWS:** Infor M3 CloudSuite is typically hosted on AWS, creating a multi-cloud environment (AWS for ERP, Azure for BI).

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **Infor M3 (ERP):** We don't implement Infor, but we *do* support the **Data Engineering** required to pull data *out* of Infor into a Data Lake for advanced analytics (beyond standard reporting).
*   **Includis (MES):** Opportunity to build custom "Shop Floor to Top Floor" connectors using **Python** or **Node.js** to bridge the gap between their machines and their Power BI dashboards.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **SAP:** While common in manufacturing, Petainer specifically chose **Infor M3**. Avoid SAP-centric pitches.
*   **QuickBooks:** Used only as a legacy/subsidiary tool; they are actively migrating *away* from this.

### 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE
**Conversation Starter 1: The "Scope 3" Data Trap**
*   **The Trigger:** Their commitment to **SBTi (Science Based Targets)** and the specific mention of "improving data inputs" in their 2024 ESG report.
*   **The Friction:** Scope 3 reporting (supply chain emissions) is notoriously difficult to automate. It usually involves manual Excel wrangling between the **Infor M3** ERP and supplier spreadsheets.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Michael, we see you're advancing your SBTi goals. Localhost can deploy a **Data Engineering pod** to automate your Scope 3 data ingestion directly from Infor M3 and your supply chain, feeding live, audit-ready dashboards in **Power BI** so you don't have to wait for annual audits."

**Conversation Starter 2: The MES-to-BI Gap**
*   **The Trigger:** The integration of **Includis MES** with **Infor M3**.
*   **The Friction:** Standard ERP connectors often miss the high-frequency "heartbeat" data from the shop floor (machine downtime, micro-stoppages) that is crucial for predictive maintenance.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Hugh, your move to Infor M3 is a great foundation. We can help you get more value from your **Includis** data by building a lightweight **Python** middleware layer that streams real-time machine health data into **Azure**, allowing your plant managers to predict downtime before it happens."

**Conversation Starter 3: Post-Migration Optimization**
*   **The Trigger:** The recent completion of the "five-country ERP rollout."
*   **The Friction:** Post-rollout, internal IT teams are often buried in support tickets and "keeping the lights on," leaving no bandwidth for innovation or custom feature development.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Now that the Infor M3 rollout is stabilized, your internal team is likely swamped with optimization requests. Localhost can provide a **Staff Augmentation pod** to handle the backlog of **Power BI** report requests and custom API integrations, freeing your core team to focus on the strategic US expansion."
