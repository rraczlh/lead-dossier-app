## 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX
**Focus: Industry 4.0, Sustainability Data, and Plant Automation (2025-2026)**

**1. [Strategic Investment]: €200M Automation Upgrade (Markt Bibart)**
*   **The Evidence:** EGGER is executing a massive €200M investment specifically for "automation and upgrading" at the Markt Bibart plant, with completion targeted for 2026. This indicates a surge in need for OT/IT integration.
*   **The Source:** [EGGER Press Release - Annual Press Conference 2025](https://www.egger.com)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **IoT & Process Automation**

**2. [Digital Product]: "Digital Services" for Decorative Collection 26+**
*   **The Evidence:** The launch of the "Decorative Collection 26+" is explicitly coupled with the "consistent development of our digital services." This implies a need for customer-facing web/mobile platforms (visualizers, ordering portals).
*   **The Source:** [EGGER News - Shaping a Sustainable Future (Jan 2026)](https://www.egger.com)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Software Engineering** (Custom Apps)

**3. [Data Initiative]: Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) Transparency**
*   **The Evidence:** EGGER's "Sustainability Journal" highlights the use of "digitalisation and automation to save energy" and provide "in-depth insights into environmental performance (PCF)." This requires complex ETL pipelines to pull energy data from machines (OT) to dashboards (IT).

*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Data & Analytic Services**

**4. [Security Signal]: IT Security as "Top Priority"**
*   **The Evidence:** The 2024/25 Financial Report explicitly states: "IT security is a top priority in all internal areas," signaling budget allocation for audits and defensive infrastructure, likely driven by the convergence of OT (Factory) and IT networks.

## 3. SERVICES & STACK INTERSECTION
**Comparison: EGGER (Manufacturing/SAP) vs. Localhost Services**

✅ **The Sweet Spot (Direct Service Matches):**
*   **IoT & Process Automation:** The **Markt Bibart** expansion is a "Digital Factory" live scenario. They are hiring "Controls Engineers" and investing in hardware.
    *   *Why it fits:* They need to extract data from new automated lines and feed it into SAP/MES.
    *   *Tech Validation:* Confirmed by "investments in automation" and "Controls Engineer" roles.
*   **Data & Analytic Services:** The **Net Zero 2050** goal requires granular energy data.
    *   *Why it fits:* Calculating a dynamic Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) requires aggregating data from disparate plant sensors, which is a classic Big Data/ETL challenge.

⚠️ **The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent/Upsell):**
*   **Platform Development:** The "Digital Services" for the **Decorative Collection 26+** suggests a move toward B2B/B2C digital platforms.
    *   *The Angle:* "Your collection is physical, but the buying experience is digital. We can build the 'Visualizer' or 'Sample Ordering API' that integrates with your SAP backend."
*   **DevOps & Cybersecurity:** With the "IT Security" alert in their annual report.
    *   *The Angle:* "As you connect more machines (OT) to the cloud (IT) at Markt Bibart, the attack surface grows. We provide the SecOps layer to protect that bridge."

❌ **The Mismatch (Out of Scope):**
*   **SAP ERP Core Implementation:**
    *   *Reason:* EGGER is a massive SAP shop. They likely use internal teams or Global SIs (Accenture/Capgemini) for core S/4HANA migration. Localhost should pitch *around* SAP (integrations), not *replace* it.

## 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE
**Pitching to Hannes Mitterweissacher (CTO)**

**Starter 1: The "Digital Factory" Gap (Markt Bibart)**
"Hannes, I've been following the €200M automation roadmap for Markt Bibart. Typically, the hardest part of these expansions isn't the hardware—it's getting the legacy PLCs to talk to the new SAP environment in real-time. Localhost specializes in that exact OT/IT middleware layer to ensure your data flows as fast as your production lines."

**Starter 2: The Sustainability Data Problem**
"Your 'Valuable 2024' journal mentioned using digitalization to track Product Carbon Footprints (PCF). Most manufacturers struggle because that energy data is trapped in silos on the factory floor. We can deploy the data pipelines needed to automate that reporting, turning your Net Zero goals into a real-time dashboard rather than a yearly audit."

**Starter 3: The Customer Experience (Collection 26+)**
"With the launch of Collection 26+, the digital experience for architects and designers is critical. We can help build the high-performance web visualizers and mobile tools that integrate with your catalog, ensuring the 'digital service' matches the quality of the wood products."
