1. DATA VALIDATION (Excel vs. Current 2026)

| Data Point | Excel Value | Current (Jan 2026) | Verification Source (Title/Link) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | 1.9 Billion EUR | **€1.847 Billion** (~$1.99B USD) | [PERI Group Annual Report / Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PERI) |
| **Key Decision Maker** | Head of Digital | **Florian Botzenhart** (Head of Digital Innovation & Development) | [Xing Profile - Florian Botzenhart](https://www.xing.com/profile/Florian_Botzenhart) |

2. THE EVIDENCE BOX (High-Signal Items)

**[Tech Infrastructure]: Azure Application Insights Usage**
*   **The Evidence:** PERI's digital privacy documentation explicitly states the use of "Microsoft Azure Application Insights" for their digital services and apps (QuickSolve, PERI CAD), confirming a .NET/Azure-centric ecosystem.
*   **The Source:** [PERI Data Protection Statement (Applications)](https://www.peri.com/en/data-protection-applications.html)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Cloud DevOps (Azure), Observability (AppDynamics/Grafana replacement or optimization).

**[Strategic Move]: IoT "InSite" Scaling with Deutsche Telekom**
*   **The Evidence:** PERI has deployed a "Digital Construction Site" initiative using NarrowBand IoT (NB-IoT) via Deutsche Telekom to track formwork and monitor concrete pressure (PERI InSite Construction). This indicates a massive influx of sensor data requiring scalable ingestion pipelines.
*   **The Source:** [PERI digitizes the construction site with IoT solutions](https://www.telekom.com/en/media/media-information/archive/peri-digitizes-construction-site-with-iot-solutions-624652)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Application Development (Backend/Node.js/Python for data ingestion), Data Science (Predictive analytics for concrete curing).

**[Leadership]: New Digital Innovation Leadership**
*   **The Evidence:** Florian Botzenhart was promoted to "Head of Digital Innovation & Development" (Sep 2023) and remains in role as of 2026, signaling a stable mandate to modernize engineering tools beyond legacy CAD.
*   **The Source:** [Florian Botzenhart - Head of Digital Innovation](https://www.xing.com/profile/Florian_Botzenhart)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Application Development (Custom .NET Core development for internal tools).

**[Product Expansion]: 3D Construction Printing (COBOD)**
*   **The Evidence:** PERI is actively printing buildings (e.g., in Texas and Germany) using COBOD BOD2 printers. This hardware-heavy initiative requires "Slicer" software and custom integrations with BIM (Building Information Modeling) data.
*   **The Source:** [PERI 3D Construction Printing Portfolio](https://www.peri3dconstruction.com/)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Application Development (C#/.NET for CAD plugins/BIM integration).

3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

✅ **The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Azure:** Confirmed via Application Insights usage.
*   **C# / .NET Core:** The standard language for Azure-based enterprise apps and PERI's engineering software (PERI CAD/QuickSolve).
*   **SAP:** Core ERP system, likely requiring integration with new digital frontends.

⚠️ **The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **IoT Data Pipelines:** They use "Open Telekom Cloud" for some IoT storage. **Opportunity:** Migrate/Mirror data to **AWS/Azure** for advanced ML/AI analytics using Localhost's Data Science squad.
*   **Frontend Modernization:** Tools like "QuickSolve" are web-based. **Opportunity:** If these are legacy ASP.NET, migrate to **React/Next.js** for better performance and mobile responsiveness.

❌ **The Mismatch:**
*   **AutoCAD Architecture:** We do not support core CAD kernel development.
*   **NarrowBand IoT Hardware:** We do not do hardware/sensor engineering.

4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The Observability Maturity Gap**
*   **The Trigger:** Their explicit use of **Azure Application Insights** across multiple apps (QuickSolve, CAD).
*   **The Logical Friction:** As they scale from simple web tools to complex IoT streams (InSite), standard App Insights often becomes noisy and expensive. They likely struggle with correlating sensor data (concrete pressure) with application performance.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Florian, we noticed you're leveraging Azure App Insights heavily. Our Observability squad specializes in tuning Azure environments to reduce noise and correlate IoT sensor metrics with system health—ensuring your 'InSite' data is as reliable as your formwork."

**Conversation Starter 2: The "Hardware-to-Software" Bottleneck**
*   **The Trigger:** The rapid expansion of **3D Construction Printing (COBOD)**.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Printing hardware is useless without seamless software that translates BIM models into printer paths ("Slicing"). This often creates a backlog of custom integration requests from architects.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "With your 3D printing projects scaling in Texas and Germany, are you finding the bridge between BIM models and the BOD2 printer seamless? We have .NET engineering pods that can build custom Revit/CAD plugins to automate that 'slicing' workflow, speeding up your print prep time."

**Conversation Starter 3: Unlocking IoT Data from the Telecom Silo**
*   **The Trigger:** The partnership with **Deutsche Telekom** for IoT data transport.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Telco clouds are great for connectivity but often lack the advanced AI/ML toolkits found in AWS or Azure. Your data might be 'stuck' in a storage silo, preventing predictive analysis on concrete curing times.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "You're capturing incredible data via the InSite sensors. We can help you build a bridge from the Open Telekom Cloud into a dedicated **Azure Data Lake**, allowing you to run predictive ML models (using Python/PyTorch) that tell site managers exactly when to strip formwork."
