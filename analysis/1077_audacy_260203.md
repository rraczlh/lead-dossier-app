### 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX
*High-signal technical breadcrumbs from 2025-2026.*

**[Hiring]: Senior Platform Engineer (Hybrid Cloud)**
*   **The Evidence:** Job postings in late 2025/Jan 2026 for "Senior Platform Engineer" explicitly require experience with **GCP (Vertex AI, BigQuery)** and **AWS (EKS)**. The role focuses on automating release pipelines and supporting the Data Team.
*   **The Source:** [ZipRecruiter / Audacy Careers - Senior Platform Engineer](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/c/Audacy,-Inc./Jobs)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** Cloud DevOps (AWS), Infrastructure (Kubernetes), Data Science (Core).

**[Strategic]: Post-Bankruptcy Digital Acceleration**
*   **The Evidence:** Audacy emerged from Chapter 11 on Sept 30, 2024, shedding $1.6B in debt. The restructuring plan explicitly earmarked capital for "digital transformation" and "ad tech" investments to compete with Spotify/iHeart.
*   **The Source:** [Audacy Official Restructuring Announcement](https://audacyinc.com)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** Application Development (Modernization).

**[AI & Data]: Acquisition of Sounder & AI Ad Tools**
*   **The Evidence:** Audacy acquired **Sounder** (AI-driven brand suitability) and is integrating it into their Triton Digital stack. Recent "State of Audio" reports (2025) highlight "predictive audiences" and AI-generated ad copy.
*   **The Source:** [Triton Digital / Audacy Press Release](https://tritondigital.com)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** Data Science/ML (Generative AI, Scikit-learn).

**[Infrastructure]: Kubernetes & Observability Overhaul**
*   **The Evidence:** Engineering roles require "Support hundreds of deployments over 10+ EKS clusters" and use **Grafana** for observability. This indicates a mature but complex Kubernetes environment needing scale.
*   **The Source:** [Indeed Job Description - Junior Platform Engineer](https://www.indeed.com)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** Observability (Grafana), Infrastructure (Kubernetes).

### 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

✅ **The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Infrastructure:** **AWS EKS** (Elastic Kubernetes Service) is central to their streaming platform. They are actively hiring for EKS maintenance.
*   **Languages:** **Python** (Data/AI teams) and **Go** (Backend/Streaming) are heavily used.
*   **Observability:** **Grafana** is their tool of choice for monitoring EKS clusters.
*   **Data Engineering:** **Airflow** is used for pipeline orchestration (found in Platform Engineer job descriptions).

⚠️ **The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **Cloud Mismatch (GCP vs. AWS):** They are building a "Data Lake" on **GCP (BigQuery, Vertex AI)**. While Localhost focuses on AWS/Azure, this creates a "Split Brain" infrastructure.
    *   *Opportunity:* Pitch **AWS Data Modernization** to consolidate data gravity back to the streaming source (AWS), or offer "Cross-Cloud Observability" using Grafana.
*   **IaC Mismatch (Terraform vs. CDK):** They use **Terraform**. Localhost specializes in **CDK/CloudFormation**.
    *   *Opportunity:* If they are struggling with Terraform state management at scale (common with 10+ clusters), pitch a migration to **CDK** for better programmatic infrastructure control.

❌ **The Mismatch:**
*   **GCP Vertex AI:** We support OpenAI/Langchain, but their job posts specifically ask for Vertex AI.
*   **Legacy Broadcasting:** Hardware-based audio processing (Orban Optimod) is outside our scope.

### 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The "Post-Bankruptcy" Innovation Gap**
*   **The Trigger:** Emergence from Chapter 11 (Sept 2024) + New CIO Steve Rollins (May 2025).
*   **The Friction:** Post-restructuring, the mandate is "growth with efficiency." Steve Rollins is likely auditing the legacy stack left by the previous CTO. They have capital but need velocity to catch up to Spotify.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Steve, with the restructuring behind you, you're likely evaluating the efficiency of the EKS clusters inherited from the previous regime. Localhost's **Kubernetes Optimization Squads** can audit your 10+ clusters to reduce AWS spend immediately, freeing up budget for your new AI initiatives."

**Conversation Starter 2: The "Split-Brain" Cloud Data Problem**
*   **The Trigger:** Job posts show Streaming on **AWS** but Data/AI on **GCP** (BigQuery/Vertex).
*   **The Friction:** Moving petabytes of audio data from AWS (where it's generated) to GCP (where it's analyzed) creates massive egress fees and latency.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "We noticed your platform engineers are bridging AWS EKS and GCP BigQuery. Localhost specializes in **Data Gravity**—we can help you architect a data plane directly on AWS using **S3 + Modern Data Stack** to eliminate those cross-cloud egress costs and simplify your pipeline."

**Conversation Starter 3: AdTech AI Modernization**
*   **The Trigger:** The acquisition of Sounder and the push for "Predictive Audiences."
*   **The Friction:** Integrating an acquired AI stack (Sounder) into a legacy radio backend (Triton/Audacy) is notoriously difficult and often stalls engineering roadmaps.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Integrating Sounder's AI capabilities into the core Audacy app requires specialized **Python/ML engineering capacity**. Our staff augmentation pods can handle the 'plumbing' work of Airflow pipelines and API integrations, allowing your core team to focus on the proprietary algorithm logic."
