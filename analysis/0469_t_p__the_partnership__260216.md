## 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX
**Context:** In March 2024, The&Partnership merged with mSix&Partners to form **T&P**, explicitly to fuse "Creative" and "Media" using AI. In Nov 2024, WPP acquired the remaining shares to make T&P their primary "AI Speedboat."

**1. [AI & ML]: The "AI Speedboat" Mandate (Nov 2024 - Present)**
*   **The Evidence:** WPP fully acquired T&P to deploy **WPP Open** (their AI OS) as the core operating model. T&P is the designated pilot entity for "AI-powered marketing models."
*   **The Source:** [WPP Announcement: T&P Full Acquisition](https://www.wpp.com/news/2024/11/wpp-brings-tandpm-fully-within-its-global-network)
*   **Localhost Service:** **AI & ML** (Implementation of LLM agents into workflows).

**2. [Software Engineering]: Video Generation Pipelines (June 2025)**
*   **The Evidence:** T&P published a case study on using **Azure OpenAI** and **Sora** APIs to build a "Video Playground" that automates creative concepting, requiring custom node-based interface development.
*   **The Source:** [Microsoft Customer Story: T&P Scales Video Creativity](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/wpp-tandpm-media-telecommunications-azure-openai-service)
*   **Localhost Service:** **Software Engineering** (Building the custom UI/middleware for these AI tools).

**3. [Data & Analytics]: The Media-Creative Merger (Ongoing)**
*   **The Evidence:** The merger with mSix&Partners (a media buying agency) created a requirement to merge "Performance Data" (Media) with "Asset Data" (Creative). They are hiring Data Strategists to bridge this gap.
*   **The Source:** [T&P Careers / Strategy Online Coverage](https://strategyonline.ca/2024/03/22/thepartnership-combines-with-msixpartners-to-form-tpm/)
*   **Localhost Service:** **Data & Analytic Services** (Unified Data Warehousing).

**4. [Cloud Services]: WPP Open Pro Deployment (Oct 2025)**
*   **The Evidence:** WPP launched "Open Pro" to let clients use AI tools directly. T&P is the agency responsible for onboarding clients (like Toyota/News Corp) onto this cloud-native platform.
*   **The Source:** [Marketing Interactive: WPP Open Pro Launch](https://www.marketing-interactive.com/wpp-launches-open-pro)
*   **Localhost Service:** **Cloud Services** (Client-side cloud configuration and security).

**5. [Platform Development]: "Connect Talent and Tech" (Mission)**
*   **The Evidence:** The new brand promise is "Connecting Talent and Tech." They are moving from a service model to a *platform-enabled* service model, requiring internal tooling for their 1,900 employees.
*   **The Source:** [T&P About Us](https://www.tandpgroup.com/about)
*   **Localhost Service:** **Platform Development** (Internal Developer Portals / Workflow Automation).

## 3. SERVICES & STACK INTERSECTION

✅ **The Sweet Spot (Direct Service Matches)**
*   **AI & ML:** T&P is aggressively implementing **WPP Open** (built on NVIDIA/Google/Azure). They need engineers to fine-tune these models for specific client tones (e.g., a "Toyota-voice" LLM).
    *   *Tech Validation:* Use of **Azure OpenAI** and **Sora API**.
*   **Data & Analytic Services:** The mSix merger brings massive programmatic ad data (Google DV360, The Trade Desk). This data must be visualized alongside creative performance.
    *   *Tech Validation:* Use of **SQL**, **Python**, and **GCP BigQuery** (common in GroupM agencies).

⚠️ **The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent/Upsell)**
*   **DevOps & Cybersecurity:** As T&P gives clients direct access to AI tools (via WPP Open Pro), security becomes a massive liability.
    *   *The Angle:* "You are opening your internal AI tools to clients like Telus and NatWest. We can provide the **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** and security audits to ensure tenant isolation."
*   **Software Engineering (Legacy Modernization):** T&P has "embedded teams" at client sites (e.g., onsite at News Corp). These teams often inherit legacy CMS or DAM systems that need modernizing to accept GenAI assets.
    *   *The Angle:* "Your AI generates assets instantly, but your client's legacy CMS can't ingest them fast enough. We build the API connectors."

❌ **The Mismatch (Out of Scope)**
*   **Media Buying / Ad Operations:** We do not execute ad campaigns or manage media spend (Google Ads/Meta Ads management).
    *   *Reason:* This is mSix&Partners' core competency and is non-engineering work.

## 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE

**Starter 1: The "AI Speedboat" Friction**
> "I read about WPP's decision to make T&P the 'AI Speedboat' for the network last November. Typically, agencies struggle to translate 'AI Strategy' into 'Production-Grade Tools' that 1,900 employees can actually use without breaking governance. Localhost's **Platform Engineering** team specializes in turning loose AI APIs (like your Sora integration) into stable, internal enterprise apps."

**Starter 2: The Media-Creative Data Gap**
> "With the mSix merger, you now have performance data and creative assets under one roof. Most agencies we audit have these in two separate data silos (Media vs. DAM). Our **Data & Analytics** service can build the 'Middleware' that automatically tags your creative assets based on the performance data coming from your media buying platforms."

**Starter 3: Client-Facing Tech Risks**
> "The launch of WPP Open Pro is a game-changer, but it turns your agency into a SaaS provider. This introduces new risks regarding **Cloud Security** and **FinOps** that traditional agencies aren't staffed to handle. We can act as the technical safeguard for your client-facing portals."
