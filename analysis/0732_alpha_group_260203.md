### 1. DATA VALIDATION (Excel vs. Current 2026)

| Data Point | Excel Value | Current (Jan 2026) | Verification Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | 100000000.0 | **$170M USD** (~£136M GBP) | [Alpha Group FY24 Results / London Stock Exchange](https://www.londonstockexchange.com/stock/ALPH/alpha-group-international-plc/company-page) |
| **Key Decision Maker** | CTO | **Sam Marsh** (CEO, Private Markets) | [Alpha Group Leadership Team](https://www.alphagroup.com/our-team/) |
| **Status** | Active | **Acquired / Integration Phase** | [Corpay Acquires Alpha Group ($2.2B Deal)](https://www.fintechfutures.com/2024/07/corpay-agrees-2-2bn-deal-to-buy-alpha-group-international/) |

> **Analyst Note:** The company is currently in a critical "Pre-Close/Integration" phase following the $2.2B acquisition by Corpay (expected close Q4 2025/early 2026). This creates a massive urgency for technical consolidation.

### 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX (High-Signal Technical Breadcrumbs)

**Type: Strategic Acquisition & Tech Integration**
*   **The Evidence:** Alpha acquired **Cobase** (a cloud-based bank connectivity platform) and is now being acquired by **Corpay**. This creates a "Russian Doll" integration challenge: merging Cobase's tech into Alpha, and Alpha's stack into Corpay.
*   **The Source:** [Alpha Group Finalizes Cobase Acquisition](https://www.alphagroup.com/investors/news/acquisition-of-cobase/)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** **Cloud Modernization Squads** (to harmonize disparate Azure/Cloud environments).

**Type: Hiring Signal (Backend Engineering)**
*   **The Evidence:** Active recruitment for "Mid Level .NET Developer" and "Software Developer (C# .NET SQL)" in London. The stack explicitly lists **.NET 6+**, **Azure**, and **Docker**.
*   **The Source:** [CWJobs / TotalJobs - Alpha Group Engineering Roles](https://www.cwjobs.co.uk/jobs/mid-level-net-developer/in-london)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** **.NET Core Migration & Staff Augmentation**.

**Type: Product Launch (New Platform)**
*   **The Evidence:** Launch of **"Alpha Match"**, a digital intermediation platform for fund finance. This requires high-performance matching algorithms and secure API layers for institutional clients.
*   **The Source:** [Alpha Match Product Announcement](https://www.alphagroup.com/fund-finance/alpha-match/)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** **React/TypeScript Frontend Pods** (for building institutional-grade dashboards).

### 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Backend:** **C# / .NET Core (.NET 6+)** is their primary engine for FX and Payments.
*   **Cloud:** **Azure** is the confirmed infrastructure provider for their London engineering team.
*   **Frontend:** **React** and **TypeScript** are used for their client-facing portals (Alpha Platform & Alpha Match).
*   **Database:** **SQL Server** is central to their data architecture.

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **Infrastructure as Code:** They mention **Docker** and **PowerShell** in job posts. There is a clear opportunity to introduce **Bicep** or **Terraform** (Localhost capability) to standardize their infrastructure deployment during the Corpay integration.
*   **Legacy Integration:** The acquisition of Cobase (likely Java/Legacy stack) presents a migration opportunity to unify onto Alpha's modern **.NET/Azure** standard.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **Oracle SQL:** They list Oracle in some legacy/backend contexts. Localhost focuses on Postgres/SQL Server/Snowflake. We should avoid pitching pure Oracle DBA services.

### 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The "Double Integration" Challenge**
*   **The Trigger:** The acquisition of Cobase followed by the Corpay merger creates a complex technical debt scenario.
*   **The Friction:** Engineering leadership is likely paralyzed by the need to maintain "Business as Usual" velocity while mapping out a massive 3-way platform consolidation (Cobase + Alpha + Corpay).
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Sam, with the Corpay integration looming, your internal team needs to focus on the strategic architecture. Localhost can deploy **'Integration Squads'** familiar with **Azure & .NET 6** to handle the tactical migration of the Cobase workloads, ensuring you hit your Q4 integration milestones without stalling the roadmap."

**Conversation Starter 2: Scaling "Alpha Match"**
*   **The Trigger:** The recent launch of the *Alpha Match* fund finance platform.
*   **The Friction:** Institutional clients demand near-zero latency and institutional-grade UI/UX. Scaling this new product while resources are diverted to the merger is risky.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "We see *Alpha Match* is gaining traction. We can provide a dedicated **React/TypeScript feature pod** to accelerate the frontend roadmap for this specific product, allowing your core team to focus on the backend payment rails."

**Conversation Starter 3: API-First Modernization**
*   **The Trigger:** Job posts emphasizing **XML/JSON APIs** and **Swagger**.
*   **The Friction:** As Alpha expands its "Alternative Banking" solution, the API layer becomes the product. Inconsistent API standards across acquired entities (Cobase) will hurt developer experience for clients.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Your move toward an API-first banking model is clear. Localhost specializes in **.NET Core API modernization**. We can audit and standardize your API gateway layer to ensure seamless interoperability between Alpha's core FX engine and the new Cobase connectivity points."
