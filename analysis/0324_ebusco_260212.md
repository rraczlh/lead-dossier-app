# 1. DATA VALIDATION (Excel vs. Current 2026)

| Data Point | Excel Value | Current (Jan 2026) | Verification Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | €102M | **€10.7M (FY24 Prelim)** / €102.4M (FY23) | [Ebusco FY2024 Update (April 2025)](https://www.ebusco.com) |
| **KDM** | CIO | **Christian Schreyer (CEO)** | [Ebusco Investor Relations](https://www.ebusco.com/investors/) |
| **Status** | Growth | **Turnaround / Distress** | [Silicon Canals: Ebusco Restructuring](https://siliconcanals.com) |

> **Critical Note:** Ebusco is in a "Turnaround" phase. FY2024 revenue collapsed to ~€10.7M due to order cancellations and accounting reversals. They raised €36M in Nov 2024 to avoid bankruptcy. **Do not pitch "Growth" services.** Pitch "Cost Optimization," "Staff Augmentation" (to replace lost FTEs), and "Critical Maintenance."

# 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX

**TYPE: STRATEGIC PIVOT**
**Signal Title:** Shift to OED (Original Equipment Design) Model
**The Evidence:** As of late 2024/2025, Ebusco has pivoted from manufacturing buses in-house to an "OED" model. They now outsource assembly to partners in China but **retain all engineering, design, and software control** in the Netherlands.
**The Source:** [Ebusco Strategy Update Q3 2025](https://www.ebusco.com/investors/)
**Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** *Engineering Staff Augmentation* (They need to maintain engineering velocity without carrying full-time headcount).

**TYPE: FINANCIAL TRIGGER**
**Signal Title:** 40% Workforce Reduction
**The Evidence:** Ebusco reduced its workforce by ~40% (from 522 to ~305 FTEs) between late 2024 and late 2025 to cut costs. This creates a "knowledge vacuum" where critical legacy knowledge (especially in embedded software) may have been lost.

**Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** *Legacy Modernization / Knowledge Transfer Pods*

**TYPE: TECH ARCHITECTURE**
**Signal Title:** "Ebusco Live" Telemetry Dependency
**The Evidence:** The "Ebusco Live" real-time monitoring platform is powered by **ChargePoint (formerly ViriCiti)**. Ebusco markets this as their own, but the backend relies on external APIs and integration.
**The Source:** [ChargePoint Case Study: Ebusco](https://www.chargepoint.com)
**Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** *API Integration & Data Engineering* (Python/SQL) to extract custom insights from the ChargePoint feed.

**TYPE: PRODUCT RELIABILITY**
**Signal Title:** Battery Telemetry & Cell Balancing
**The Evidence:** Ebusco 3.0 buses feature lightweight composite bodies and require precise battery management down to the "thousandth of a volt." This requires low-level C++ embedded programming and real-time data piping.

**Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** *C++ / Embedded Systems Development*

# 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **C++ & Linux:** Core stack for the vehicle control units (VCUs) and on-board telemetry gateways.
*   **Python:** Likely used for off-board data analysis and scripting within their engineering teams.
*   **REST API:** Essential for the integration between the bus (CAN bus data) and the ChargePoint/Ebusco Live cloud dashboard.

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **Azure/Cloud Platforms:** While they use ChargePoint for the dashboard, they likely have an internal "Data Lake" for engineering analysis (battery degradation modeling). Moving this to a managed **Azure/AWS** environment is a strong pitch.
*   **Dashboarding:** They currently rely on a vendor. Pitching a **React/Next.js** custom dashboard to give them "Data Sovereignty" (owning their own fleet data) is a high-value strategic move.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **Manufacturing Hardware:** We cannot help with Composite Materials, Carbon Fiber manufacturing, or physical assembly (which they are outsourcing anyway).

# 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The "OED" Engineering Gap**
*   **The Trigger:** "Christian, I saw the strategic pivot to the OED model and the successful rights issue in November. It’s a bold move to keep the IP while outsourcing the heavy lifting."
*   **The Logical Friction:** "With the reduction in internal FTEs (the 40% cut), the remaining engineering team is likely stretched thin maintaining the Ebusco 3.0 software stack while managing the new Chinese manufacturing partners."
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Localhost can provide a **dedicated C++/Embedded pod** to handle the 'Keep the Lights On' maintenance of the VCU software. This frees your core architects to focus strictly on the new OED quality assurance, giving you flexible capacity without increasing your fixed payroll."

**Conversation Starter 2: Data Sovereignty (Ebusco Live)**
*   **The Trigger:** "I noticed Ebusco Live is a key differentiator for the 3.0 series, currently leveraging the ChargePoint/ViriCiti infrastructure."
*   **The Logical Friction:** "As you scale the OED model, relying entirely on a third-party vendor for your data layer creates a blind spot. You might be missing raw battery diagnostics that are crucial for warranty claims with your new contract manufacturers."
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "We can deploy a small **Python/Data Engineering squad** to build a 'Sidecar' data pipeline. We'll extract raw telemetry directly to a private Ebusco Azure instance, ensuring you own the 'Truth' about your battery performance, independent of your telematics vendor."

**Conversation Starter 3: The "Turnaround" Speed**
*   **The Trigger:** "The 2025 turnaround plan emphasizes 'Delivery Reliability' above all else."
*   **The Logical Friction:** "Software bugs in the fleet management system or the bus HMI (Human Machine Interface) are the fastest way to kill customer confidence during a turnaround."
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Localhost specializes in **Automated QA and Testing**. We can set up a rigorous 'Hardware-in-the-Loop' testing framework for your software releases, ensuring that every bus delivered from the new assembly lines works perfectly on Day 1, protecting your brand during this critical recovery phase."
