## 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX
**[Leadership]: CEO Departure Creates Strategic Vacuum**
*   **The Evidence:** Ryan Aytay, CEO of Tableau, announced his departure on Feb 2, 2026, after 19 years at Salesforce. No permanent successor was immediately named.
*   **The Source:** [GeekWire: Tableau CEO Ryan Aytay departs Salesforce (Feb 3, 2026)](https://www.geekwire.com)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Outsourcing Services** (Staff Augmentation during transition)

**[Engineering]: Hiring for "Tableau Next" AI Infrastructure**
*   **The Evidence:** Job postings for "Senior Full Stack Engineering, Tableau" (Feb 11, 2026) explicitly mention building the "Spring-based LLM Gateway that powers our new AI Agents" and maintaining "complex C++ systems."
*   **The Source:** [Salesforce Careers: Senior Full Stack Engineering (Feb 2026)](https://careers.salesforce.com)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **AI & ML** (LLM Gateway construction)

**[Product]: "Tableau Next" & Agentforce Integration**
*   **The Evidence:** Tableau has rebranded its core evolution as "Tableau Next" (formerly Tableau Einstein), deeply integrating with Salesforce "Agentforce" to allow natural language queries to generate visualizations.
*   **The Source:** [Tableau Blog: How Tableau Enriches Agentforce (Feb 27, 2025/2026)](https://www.tableau.com)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Platform Development** (Microservices for Agentic AI)

**[Architecture]: Hybrid C++ / Cloud Native Stack**
*   **The Evidence:** Engineering roles require navigating between "legacy C++ systems (Qt framework)" and "modern scalable Java microservices" on AWS/Hyperforce.

*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Software Engineering** (Legacy Modernization)

**[Cloud]: The "Data Cloud" Dependency**
*   **The Evidence:** FY25 results highlight "Data Cloud & AI" growing 120% YoY. Tableau is the visualization layer *on top* of Data Cloud, requiring massive backend data engineering to ensure performance at scale (50 trillion records).

## 3. SERVICES & STACK INTERSECTION

### ✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Service Matches)
*   **AI & ML:** Tableau is aggressively hiring to build "LLM Gateways" and "Agentic Analytics." They need engineers who understand the intersection of Large Language Models and deterministic data visualization.
    *   *Why it fits:* They are building "Tableau Next" which relies on the Einstein Trust Layer.
    *   *Tech Validation:* Active use of **Python**, **GenAI**, and **Spring Boot** for AI agents.
*   **Software Engineering (Legacy Modernization):** They explicitly mention the burden of maintaining the **C++ / Qt** desktop legacy codebase while simultaneously building **Java microservices**.
    *   *Why it fits:* This is a classic "strangler fig" pattern where they need help keeping the lights on for the legacy desktop app while innovation happens in the cloud.

### ⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent/Upsell)
*   **Platform Development:** The shift to "Tableau Next" is a platform play, moving from a tool to a headless BI engine.
    *   *The Angle:* "Your job posts mention a struggle between C++ and Cloud Native. We can provide a dedicated pod to handle the **Java Microservices** migration so your core team can focus on the AI logic."
*   **DevOps & Cybersecurity:** With the integration into **Agentforce**, security boundaries become critical.
    *   *The Angle:* "As you expose internal data to AI Agents, the security surface area explodes. Our DevSecOps audit can ensure your new LLM Gateways don't leak PII."

### ❌ The Mismatch (Out of Scope)
*   **IoT & Process Automation:** While Tableau *visualizes* IoT data, they do not build the hardware or the edge collection layer.
    *   *Reason:* They are a software layer, not a hardware integrator.

## 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE

**Starter 1: The Leadership/Execution Gap**
"I saw the news regarding Ryan Aytay's departure earlier this month. During leadership transitions, engineering roadmaps often freeze or fragment. Localhost can deploy a 'continuity team' to ensure the **Tableau Next** microservices migration hits its Q3 targets despite the executive shuffle."

**Starter 2: The C++ vs. Cloud Friction**
"Your recent engineering posts highlight a specific challenge: balancing the **Qt/C++ legacy** with new **Java/Spring AI agents**. We specialize in this exact hybrid state—maintaining the desktop core while accelerating the cloud-native buildout, so your senior engineers aren't bogged down in technical debt."

**Starter 3: The Agentforce Integration**
"With the aggressive push into **Agentforce**, the bottleneck is often the data engineering required to make the 'Agent' smart enough to visualize data correctly. We can support your Data Cloud integration teams to ensure the underlying pipelines (ETL/ELT) are robust enough to support real-time AI queries."
