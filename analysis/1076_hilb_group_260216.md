## 1. DATA VALIDATION (Excel vs. Current 2026)

| Data Point | Excel Value | Current (Jan 2026) | Verification Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | $1,000,000,000 | **$641M** (Brokerage Rev) | [Business Insurance Top 100 (2025 Edition)](https://www.businessinsurance.com/) |
| **Key Decision Maker** | CIO | **Bert Hardy** (CIO) | [Hilb Group Leadership Team](https://www.hilbgroup.com/about-us/leadership-team/) |

**Analyst Note:** The $1B figure in the Excel likely refers to *Gross Written Premium* (GWP) or a pro-forma projection including pending acquisitions. The $641M figure is the verified *Brokerage Revenue* used for industry ranking.

## 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX
**[Strategy]: Aggressive M&A "Buy & Build"**
*   **The Evidence:** Hilb Group secured over $500M in new debt capacity in late 2024/2025 specifically to fuel further acquisitions, continuing a streak of 100+ deals since 2019.
*   **The Source:** [ProgramBusiness - M&A Activity & Refinancing](https://programbusiness.com/news/hilb-groups-ma-activity-continues-after-debt-refinancing/)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Data & Analytic Services** (Due diligence & post-merger data integration).

**[Hiring]: Salesforce & GTM Systems Administration**
*   **The Evidence:** Active recruitment for "Salesforce and GTM Systems Administrator" and "Sales Team Coordinator" with CRM expertise. This indicates a centralized sales layer sitting on top of disparate agency management systems.
*   **The Source:** [Hilb Group Careers / BuiltIn](https://builtin.com/company/hilb-group/jobs)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Platform Development** (CRM Customization & Integration).

**[Role]: Business Analytics & Transformation**
*   **The Evidence:** Leadership structure includes a "SVP, Transformation and Shared Services" (Charles Babcock) and "SVP, Business Analytics" (Robin Reinarz). This proves a mandate to centralize operations across the acquired portfolio.
*   **The Source:** [Hilb Group Leadership Page](https://www.hilbgroup.com/about-us/leadership-team/)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Data & Analytic Services** (Centralized Reporting/BI).

## 3. SERVICES & STACK INTERSECTION
Comparison of **Hilb Group** Stack vs. Localhost Official Services.

✅ **The Sweet Spot (Direct Service Matches):**
*   **Data & Analytic Services**: **Post-Merger Data Unification**
    *   *Why it fits:* Every agency Hilb acquires brings a different database (AMS360, Epic, or legacy on-prem). They explicitly have an "SVP of Business Analytics," creating a direct need for ETL pipelines to feed a central Power BI dashboard for the Carlyle Group (PE Owners).
    *   *Tech Validation:* Confirmed use of **Power BI** and **SQL** in analytics roles.

*   **Platform Development**: **The "Broker Portal" Layer**
    *   *Why it fits:* They are hiring for **Salesforce** administrators. A common pattern in PE-backed brokerages is building a custom "Producer Portal" on Salesforce that talks to the back-office AMS (Vertafore/Applied) via API, allowing agents to view data without logging into legacy systems.
    *   *Tech Validation:* **Salesforce** + **API Integration** needs.

⚠️ **The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent/Upsell):**
*   **Cloud Services**: **Infrastructure Consolidation**
    *   *The Angle:* As they acquire small agencies, they inherit on-premise servers and technical debt. Pitching a "Lift and Shift" to **Azure** (managed via FinOps) reduces their IT overhead and security risk—a key concern for their CIO, Bert Hardy.
*   **AI & ML**: **Cross-Sell Prediction**
    *   *The Angle:* With millions of policy records in their data lake, they are sitting on a goldmine for GenAI. We can pitch a model that scans client portfolios to recommend "gap coverage" (e.g., suggesting Cyber Liability to a client who only has General Liability).

❌ **The Mismatch (Out of Scope):**
*   **Core Insurance ERP Building**:
    *   *Reason:* They will not build their own General Ledger or Policy Admin System; they will license **Vertafore** or **Applied Systems**. We should not pitch building a core AMS from scratch.

## 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE
**Conversation Starters for Bert Hardy (CIO) or Charles Babcock (SVP Transformation):**

**Starter 1: The "Integration Velocity" Trigger**
"Bert, I saw the recent debt financing to fuel further M&A. Typically, the bottleneck isn't buying the agency, it's normalizing their legacy data into your central reporting layer. Localhost has specialized ETL squads that can map incoming 'dirty' data to your master schema in 48 hours, accelerating your time-to-value for new acquisitions."

**Starter 2: The "Salesforce vs. AMS" Friction**
"With your investment in Salesforce, many brokers struggle with the 'swivel chair' effect—typing data into Salesforce and then re-keying it into Vertafore/Epic. We can build a bi-directional API middleware that syncs your Producer Portal with your back-office systems, ensuring your 'SVP of Business Analytics' gets real-time numbers without manual entry."

**Starter 3: The PE Efficiency Play**
"Given Carlyle's focus on EBITDA margins, maintaining disparate on-prem servers for 100+ offices is a cost leak. We can execute a 'Hub-and-Spoke' cloud migration to Azure, centralizing security and reducing your hardware refresh costs by 30% within 12 months."
