### 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX (High-Signal Items)

**[M&A Event]: Acquisition of Capsifi (Dec 2024)**
*   **The Evidence:** Orbus acquired Capsifi, a leading business architecture provider, in December 2024 to merge capabilities into the OrbusInfinity platform. This creates an immediate need for platform consolidation and data migration engineering.
*   **The Source:** [Orbus Software Acquires Capsifi - Press Release](https://www.orbussoftware.com/company/news/orbus-software-acquires-capsifi)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Cloud Modernization (Platform Consolidation) & Data Engineering.

**[Investment]: FTV Capital Growth Equity (Dec 2024)**
*   **The Evidence:** Secured significant growth equity from FTV Capital (alongside existing investor SilverTree) to accelerate AI innovation and global expansion.
*   **The Source:** [Orbus Software Announces Strategic Investment](https://www.orbussoftware.com/company/news/strategic-investment-ftv-capital)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Staff Augmentation (Scaling Engineering Pods).

**[Product Launch]: OrbusInfinity AI (Azure OpenAI)**
*   **The Evidence:** Active development of "OrbusInfinity AI" utilizing Azure OpenAI for generative insights. They are specifically hiring for roles involving "standardized development practices" and "low-code orchestration" on Azure.
*   **The Source:** [Orbus Software AI Roadmap](https://www.orbussoftware.com/platform/ai)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Generative AI (Azure OpenAI) & Backend Development (.NET).

**[Hiring]: Solutions Developers (Poland/Remote)**
*   **The Evidence:** Hiring "Solutions Developers" with specific requirements for **C#**, **JavaScript/TypeScript**, and **Azure DevOps** to build orchestrated components.
*   **The Source:** [Orbus Careers - Solutions Developer](https://careers.orbussoftware.com/jobs)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** .NET Core Development & DevOps Engineering.

### 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Cloud & DevOps:** Microsoft Azure, Azure DevOps (CI/CD).
*   **Backend:** C#, .NET Core (Essential for their platform orchestration).
*   **Frontend:** React (Used in their SaaS portal UI).
*   **AI/ML:** Azure OpenAI (Direct match for Localhost's GenAI capability).
*   **Database:** SQL Server.

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **Low-Code/Integration:** They heavily use **Logic Apps** and **Power Automate**. Localhost's **Power Fx** capability is a direct entry point here to support their "Solutions Team" which builds custom client integrations.
*   **Data Visualization:** They rely on **Power BI**. Localhost's Data Science team (Pandas/Polars) can offer advanced data preparation services feeding into their Power BI dashboards.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **Legacy Microsoft:** Heavy reliance on SharePoint/Visio integrations. Unless Localhost has specific M365 plugin development experience, this specific niche is a mismatch.

### 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The "Capsifi" Integration Headache**
*   **The Trigger:** The December 2024 acquisition of Capsifi.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Merging two distinct SaaS codebases (OrbusInfinity + Capsifi) usually results in massive technical debt, fragmented identity management, and slowed feature velocity for the core product.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Gareth, acquisitions often stall roadmaps while engineering fights fires on integration. Localhost can deploy a dedicated **Azure Migration Pod** to handle the Capsifi data/identity merger, allowing your core team to keep shipping OrbusInfinity features without velocity loss."

**Conversation Starter 2: Accelerating the AI Roadmap**
*   **The Trigger:** The FTV Capital investment specifically earmarked for "AI Innovation" and the launch of OrbusInfinity AI.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Sourcing senior engineers with specific **Azure OpenAI** production experience is difficult; most are still in the 'experimentation' phase.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "With the new FTV capital fueling your AI push, you likely need to move from 'GenAI Pilot' to production scale. Our team has shipped production **Azure OpenAI** agents using Langchain—we can help you build the 'intelligent recommendation' layer of OrbusInfinity immediately."

**Conversation Starter 3: The "Low-Code" Bottleneck**
*   **The Trigger:** Active hiring for "Solutions Developers" requiring C# *and* Power Platform skills.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Finding "Pro-Code" developers (C#) who are willing to do "Low-Code" (Power Automate) work is notoriously hard; retention in this hybrid role is usually poor.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "I noticed you're hiring for the Solutions Team to build custom client orchestrations. Instead of burning out core C# devs on Logic Apps, Localhost can provide a **flexible .NET/Power Platform squad** to handle these custom client integrations, keeping your internal R&D focused on the core SaaS kernel."
