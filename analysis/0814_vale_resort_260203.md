### 1. DATA VALIDATION
| Data Point | Excel Value | Current (Jan 2026) | Verification Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | 20000000.0 | **£20M (Resort) / £100M+ (Group)** | [Leekes Ltd Financials / Business Live](https://www.business-live.co.uk/retail-consumer/vale-glamorgan-gin-distillery-switches-18106540) |
| **Key Decision Maker** | [Name] | **Mike Fowler (Group FD) / Geraint Martin (Head of E-com)** | [Leekes Careers / Big Eye Deers Case Study](https://www.bigeyedeers.co.uk/work/leekes) |
| **Tech Stack** | Hotel Ops | **Magento (Retail) / W1G App (Resort)** | [App Store Listing](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/the-vale-resort/id903333333) |

### 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX
**[E-Commerce]: Magento Optimization & ERP Integration**
*   **The Evidence:** Leekes Retail (parent company) actively invests in "Enhancing Leekes Magento Commerce" to integrate with their internal ERP system. This indicates a reliance on PHP/Magento for the group's revenue engine.
*   **The Source:** [Big Eye Deers Case Study - Leekes Magento](https://www.bigeyedeers.co.uk/work/leekes)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** PHP Development, API Integration, Data Engineering.

**[Mobile App]: Outsourced "White Label" Guest Experience**
*   **The Evidence:** The "Vale Resort" mobile app is developed by "(UK) W1G Ltd" (Whole In One Golf), a niche white-label provider. This suggests they lack internal mobile engineering capabilities and rely on rigid, off-the-shelf solutions.
*   **The Source:** [Apple App Store - Vale Resort](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/the-vale-resort/id903333333)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** React Native / Flutter (Custom App Development).

**[Manufacturing]: Hensol Castle Distillery Scale-Up**
*   **The Evidence:** The group invested £7M into the Hensol Castle Distillery (on resort grounds), creating a manufacturing, retail, and tourism hub. This creates complex inventory and data needs (tracking spirits from production to retail sale vs. resort consumption).
*   **The Source:** [Business Live - Distillery Investment](https://www.business-live.co.uk/retail-consumer/vale-glamorgan-gin-distillery-switches-18106540)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** SQL Server / Data Analytics (Inventory Logic).

### 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION
**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **PHP / Magento:** The retail arm is anchored on Magento. Localhost's **PHP** experts can support high-complexity customizations or ERP integrations that their agency might struggle with.
*   **SQL Server:** As a mid-market UK enterprise with retail and hospitality arms, their data backbone is almost certainly SQL-based (supporting the ERP and POS).

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **Mobile Modernization:** They currently use a generic "Golf App" vendor. A **React Native** or **Flutter** cross-platform app could unify the *Retail* loyalty program (Leekes) with the *Resort* guest experience (Vale), driving cross-sell revenue.
*   **Data Unification:** Connecting the **Magento** sales data with the **Resort** booking data (likely siloed) to create a "Single View of Customer."

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **Cloud Native / DevOps:** There is no evidence of a mature internal DevOps team (Kubernetes, AWS Lambda). They likely rely on traditional hosting or MSPs. Pitching "Cloud Modernization" is premature unless framed as "Cost Reduction."

### 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE
**Conversation Starter 1: The "Unified Guest" Angle**
*   **The Trigger:** You have a Magento store for Retail and a White-Label App for the Resort.
*   **The Logical Friction:** "I imagine it's difficult to recognize a high-value Resort guest when they walk into a Leekes store (or visit the website), causing missed cross-sell opportunities."
*   **The Partnership Angle:** Localhost can build a **Data Bridge (SQL/API)** between your Magento instance and your Resort PMS, allowing you to target Resort guests with specific Retail offers automatically.

**Conversation Starter 2: The Mobile Experience Upgrade**
*   **The Trigger:** The current Vale Resort app is built by a Golf-specific vendor (W1G).
*   **The Logical Friction:** "Off-the-shelf apps are great for golf scores, but they often fail to capture the full revenue potential of Spa bookings, Dining reservations, and Distillery tours in one seamless journey."
*   **The Partnership Angle:** We can deploy a **React Native** pod to build a custom "Vale Life" app that integrates *all* revenue streams (Golf, Spa, Gin, Retail) into one branded experience, without the limitations of a template.

**Conversation Starter 3: Distillery Inventory Complexity**
*   **The Trigger:** The £7M investment in Hensol Castle Distillery and the shift to commercial spirit production.
*   **The Logical Friction:** "Managing inventory for a manufacturing operation (Distillery) inside a hospitality business (Resort) usually breaks standard ERP modules."
*   **The Partnership Angle:** Localhost's **Database Engineers** can help custom-script your inventory logic to ensure your ERP accurately tracks 'Angel's Share' losses vs. retail sales, preventing stock-outs and reporting errors.
