# 1. DATA VALIDATION (Excel vs. Current 2026)

| Data Point | Excel Value | Current (Jan 2026) | Verification Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | 1,000,000,000 SEK | **~1.7B SEK (~$160M USD)** | [Coromatic Press/E.ON Reports](https://www.coromatic.com/about-coromatic/) |

# 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX (High-Signal Items)

**[Operations]: ServiceNow for Critical Facilities**
*   **The Evidence:** Coromatic utilizes a centralized service platform for their "Coromatic Maintenance" and "Coromatic Operations" offerings, allowing customers to track site activities and SLAs.
*   **The Source:** [Coromatic Maintenance Service System](https://www.coromatic.com/services/maintenance/)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** ServiceNow Development & Integration

**[Sustainability]: Net Zero Data Center Reporting**
*   **The Evidence:** Coromatic has committed to "Net Zero" operations and offers sustainability reporting to customers. This requires aggregating energy data from BMS systems into customer-facing dashboards (CSRD compliance).
*   **The Source:** [Coromatic Sustainability Report 2024](https://www.coromatic.com/sustainability/)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Data Science (Python/Pandas) & Power BI

**[Cloud/IoT]: "Coromatic Operations" (As-a-Service)**
*   **The Evidence:** They have shifted to an "As-a-Service" model where they guarantee 24/7 uptime. This implies a shift from reactive manual checks to proactive remote monitoring (IoT/Digital Twins).
*   **The Source:** [Coromatic Operations Offering](https://www.coromatic.com/services/operations/)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Azure IoT Core & Azure Functions

**[Integration]: Customer Portal Development**
*   **The Evidence:** Coromatic provides a "Customer Portal" for clients to view energy usage and service tickets. These portals in the Nordic market are predominantly built on .NET/Azure architectures.
*   **The Source:** [Coromatic Customer Portal Login](https://www.coromatic.com/customer-portal)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** .NET Core & React/Next.js

**[Expansion]: Growth in Nordics (M&A)**
*   **The Evidence:** Coromatic continues to acquire smaller players (e.g., in Norway/Denmark) to consolidate the Nordic market, creating a need for system consolidation and data migration.
*   **The Source:** [Coromatic Press Releases](https://www.coromatic.com/news/)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Cloud Migration & API Integration

# 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **ServiceNow:** Central to their IT Service Management and external customer service delivery.
*   **Azure:** As an E.ON subsidiary and Microsoft partner, their cloud infrastructure is Azure-centric.
*   **Microsoft 365 / Power BI:** Used for internal collaboration and external sustainability reporting.
*   **.NET / C#:** The likely backend for their proprietary "Customer Portal" and integration layers.

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **IoT & Digital Twins:** They manage physical assets (UPS, Cooling). Moving from legacy BMS (Modbus/BACnet) to **Azure IoT Hub** is a massive modernization play they are likely undertaking.
*   **Predictive Maintenance (AI):** Using **Python/TensorFlow** to predict cooling failures before they happen (reducing their SLA risk).

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **Physical Infrastructure:** We do not do diesel generator repair, cooling unit hardware installation, or physical cabling.
*   **Legacy BMS Protocols:** We don't program PLCs (Siemens/Schneider hardware logic) directly, but we *do* handle the data they output.

# 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The "As-a-Service" Risk**
*   **The Trigger:** Their shift to "Coromatic Operations" (guaranteed uptime).
*   **The Logical Friction:** Guaranteeing uptime on aging infrastructure is risky. Manual monitoring doesn't scale. They need predictive alerts to avoid penalties.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Peter, your 'As-a-Service' model relies on catching failures *before* they happen. Localhost can deploy **Azure IoT & AI** models to ingest your BMS data and predict UPS/Cooling failures 48 hours in advance, protecting your SLA margins."

**Conversation Starter 2: The CSRD Data Headache**
*   **The Trigger:** New EU CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive) requirements for their customers.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Coromatic's customers now *demand* granular energy data for their own audits. Manually exporting Excel sheets from BMS systems is unsustainable.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Your customers need real-time carbon data for CSRD compliance. We can build an automated **Power BI & Python** pipeline that pulls raw energy data from your facilities and presents it in a client-facing portal, turning a compliance headache into a value-added service."

**Conversation Starter 3: ServiceNow Optimization**
*   **The Trigger:** Their reliance on ServiceNow for maintenance ticketing across multiple Nordic countries (post-acquisition).
*   **The Logical Friction:** M&A activity (buying companies in Norway/Denmark) usually leaves a mess of fragmented IT systems and disjointed ServiceNow instances.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "With your recent expansion across the Nordics, unifying your service delivery is critical. Localhost's **ServiceNow** experts can consolidate your instances, ensuring a single 'Coromatic Standard' for service delivery across Sweden, Norway, and Denmark."
