### 1. DATA VALIDATION (Excel vs. Current 2026)

| Data Point | Excel Value | Current (Feb 2026) | Verification Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | $2,000M | **$5,780M** (Segment) | [Salesforce FY25 Earnings / Bullfincher](https://bullfincher.io) |
| **Key Decision Maker** | [Name] | **Vacant / Interim** | [GeekWire: Ryan Aytay Departs Feb 2026](https://www.geekwire.com) |
| **Status** | Active | **Transitioning** | CEO Departure + Hyperforce Migration |

**Analyst Note:** Revenue is reported under Salesforce's "Integration and Analytics" segment (Tableau + MuleSoft), which hit ~$5.78B in FY2025. Ryan Aytay (CEO) announced his departure in Feb 2026, creating a significant leadership vacuum during a critical product pivot to "Agentic Analytics."

### 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX (High-Signal Technical Breadcrumbs)

**[Infrastructure]: Hyperforce Migration (Public Cloud Re-platforming)**
*   **The Evidence:** Tableau Cloud is actively migrating to "Hyperforce," Salesforce's next-gen infrastructure built on **AWS**. This requires massive re-architecting using **Terraform** (IaC) and **Kubernetes** to ensure data residency and compliance (PCI-DSS, IRAP).
*   **The Source:** [Tableau Cloud Hyperforce Migration Guide (Sept 2025)](https://www.tableau.com)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, DevOps Modernization.

**[AI & Product]: Tableau Pulse & "Agentic Analytics"**
*   **The Evidence:** The 2025 roadmap focuses on "Tableau Pulse," a headless BI layer powered by **Generative AI** (Einstein/OpenAI). The architecture involves a "Metrics Layer" and Python-based backend services to deliver natural language insights via **Slack** and Email.
*   **The Source:** [Tableau Pulse Architecture & AI Features (Dec 2025)](https://www.tableau.com)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** Python, OpenAI, Slack API, Backend Engineering.

**[Integration]: Semantic Model & Open API Expansion**
*   **The Evidence:** In the 2025.3 release, Tableau introduced a "Platform Data API" and "Semantic Model AI Optimization." This allows programmatic access to event logs and data models, requiring robust API integration skills (**REST**, **GraphQL** patterns).
*   **The Source:** [Tableau 2025.3 Release Notes (Dec 2025)](https://www.tableau.com)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** REST API, Data Engineering, System Integration.

**[Talent]: Core Engineering Hiring Patterns**
*   **The Evidence:** Job postings for 2025/2026 indicate a continued need for **C++** (VizQL engine optimization), **Java** (Server backend), and **React/TypeScript** (Modern web frontend for Tableau Cloud).
*   **The Source:** [Tableau Developer Careers / Indeed 2025 Analysis](https://www.indeed.com)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** C++, Java, React, TypeScript.

**[Data]: Warehouse Native Integration**
*   **The Evidence:** Deepening native integrations with **Snowflake** and **Databricks** (Zero Copy) to support "Live" queries rather than extracts. This shifts engineering load to optimizing SQL generation and connector performance.
*   **The Source:** [Tableau & Databricks/Snowflake Integration Blogs (2025)](https://www.salesforce.com)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** Snowflake, Databricks, SQL Optimization.

### 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Core Backend:** Java, C++ (Legacy Engine maintenance), Python (AI/Analytics services).
*   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript (Tableau Cloud/Pulse UI).
*   **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS (Hyperforce foundation), Kubernetes, Terraform.
*   **Data & AI:** Snowflake, Databricks, OpenAI (via Einstein Trust Layer).

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **Agentforce (AI Agents):** They are betting the farm on "Agentic AI." While proprietary to Salesforce, the underlying logic requires strong **Python** and **LLM orchestration** skills (LangChain equivalent) which Localhost possesses.
*   **Headless BI:** The shift to "Tableau Pulse" decouples the frontend. Opportunities exist in building custom frontends using **React/Next.js** that consume Tableau's new Metrics API.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **Proprietary VizQL:** The core visual query language is proprietary C++ code; we cannot touch the kernel, but we can build *around* it (connectors, embedding).
*   **Apex:** Salesforce native language (though less relevant for Tableau core engineering compared to Java/C++).

### 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Starter 1: The "Hyperforce" Talent Gap**
*   **The Trigger:** The massive migration of Tableau Cloud to AWS-based Hyperforce (confirmed Sept 2025).
*   **The Logical Friction:** Migrating a 20-year-old legacy codebase (C++/Java) to a cloud-native Kubernetes architecture (Hyperforce) creates immense technical debt and distracts core product teams from feature work.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Your core team is focused on 'Agentic Analytics' features. Localhost's **AWS & Kubernetes pods** can handle the 'lift-and-shift' grunt work of the Hyperforce migration, ensuring you hit data residency compliance in Germany/Asia without slowing down the roadmap."

**Starter 2: The "Headless" UI Pivot**
*   **The Trigger:** The launch of "Tableau Pulse" and the 2025.3 Platform Data API.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Moving from "Dashboards" to "Feeds" (Pulse) requires building entirely new web-based consumer experiences. Their internal frontend teams (React/TS) are likely stretched thin redesigning the entire UX for AI.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "With the shift to Tableau Pulse, the frontend load has doubled. Localhost's **React & TypeScript experts** can accelerate the development of the new 'Metrics Layer' UI components, allowing your internal design team to focus on the AI user experience."

**Starter 3: The Leadership Vacuum Risk**
*   **The Trigger:** CEO Ryan Aytay's departure in Feb 2026 with no named successor.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Executive turnover often freezes headcount approvals, yet the engineering roadmap (AI Agents) cannot pause. Managers are likely under pressure to deliver "Agentforce" integration with frozen FTE budgets.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "We know leadership transitions can freeze FTE hiring, but the 2026 AI roadmap doesn't stop. Localhost can provide **flexible engineering squads (Python/Java)** to keep the 'Agentforce' integration velocity high during this interim period, bypassing the FTE freeze."
