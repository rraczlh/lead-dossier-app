1. DATA VALIDATION (Excel vs. Current 2026)

| Data Point | Excel Value | Current (Jan 2026) | Verification Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | 20000000.0 | **$20M - $35M (Est.)** | [Series B Funding Data ($35M raised)](https://florence.co.uk/blog) |
| **Key Decision Maker** | CTO | **Daniel Blake (Co-founder/COO)** | [Florence Team Page](https://florence.co.uk/about-us) |
| **Tech Stack** | React, Node.js | **React, TypeScript, Rails, Flutter** | [Startup.jobs Engineering Profile](https://startup.jobs/engineering-manager-at-florence) |

2. THE EVIDENCE BOX (High-Signal Items)

**[Infrastructure]: Heroku PaaS Dependency**
*   **The Evidence:** Job specifications for Engineering Management explicitly list the infrastructure as "Heroku" rather than a raw cloud provider like AWS or Azure.
*   **The Source:** [Startup.jobs - Engineering Manager Role Description](https://startup.jobs/engineering-manager-at-florence)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Cloud Modernization (Migrating PaaS to AWS/Azure Kubernetes for cost/scale control).

**[Mobile Development]: Flutter for Gig-Workforce**
*   **The Evidence:** The core "Florence" app for nurses and carers is built using Flutter (Dart), enabling cross-platform deployment from a single codebase.
*   **The Source:** [Florence Careers / Tech Stack Disclosure](https://startup.jobs/engineering-manager-at-florence)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Mobile Development (Flutter).

**[Frontend Architecture]: TypeScript Migration**
*   **The Evidence:** While earlier stacks utilized vanilla JS, current engineering mandates specify "React / TypeScript" for the web platform.
*   **The Source:** [Florence Engineering Blog / Job Posts](https://florence.co.uk/careers)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Application Development (TypeScript/React).

**[Marketplace Logic]: Real-time Availability Matching**
*   **The Evidence:** The platform requires high-concurrency matching of shift availability to nurse profiles, currently handled by a Ruby on Rails backend with Redis caching.
*   **The Source:** [Florence Product Engineering Overview](https://florence.co.uk/about-us)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Database Optimization (Redis/Postgres).

3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

✅ **The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript (Core Localhost capability).
*   **Mobile:** Flutter (Matches Localhost Mobile capability).
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL, Redis.

⚠️ **The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **Infrastructure:** They are currently on **Heroku**. This is a prime target for **AWS/Azure Migration** (Localhost Cloud DevOps) to reduce opex as they scale beyond Series B.
*   **Backend:** They rely heavily on **Ruby on Rails**. While not a primary Localhost backend (we list .NET/Node), their move to TypeScript on the frontend suggests a potential openness to **Node.js** for new microservices (which matches Localhost).

❌ **The Mismatch:**
*   **Legacy Backend:** Core monolith is likely Ruby on Rails. We do not list Ruby/Rails as a primary capability. We should focus on the *infrastructure* hosting that Rails app (AWS/Containers) or the *frontend* consuming it.

4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The "Heroku Ceiling" (Infrastructure)**
*   **The Trigger:** Research indicates your core platform is hosted on Heroku.
*   **The Logical Friction:** As marketplace volume grows ($35M+ funding implies scaling), Heroku's convenience tax becomes expensive, and lack of granular control limits performance tuning for real-time shift matching.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** Localhost's Cloud DevOps squad can design a "Lift and Containerize" strategy to move your Rails/Node workloads to AWS EKS or Azure AKS, cutting hosting costs by ~30% and improving latency for mobile users.

**Conversation Starter 2: The "Super-App" Stability (Mobile)**
*   **The Trigger:** Your reliance on Flutter for the nurse-facing app is critical for your "gig economy" model.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Maintaining feature parity across iOS/Android while handling real-time push notifications for shift drops often leads to technical debt in state management.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** Our specialized Mobile Pods (Flutter/React Native) can augment your existing mobile team to accelerate feature delivery (e.g., instant pay integration) without disrupting the core booking flow.

**Conversation Starter 3: The TypeScript Unification (Architecture)**
*   **The Trigger:** You've standardized on TypeScript for the frontend.
*   **The Logical Friction:** If the backend remains in Rails, you have a context-switching cost for full-stack developers.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** Localhost can deploy Node.js/TypeScript backend engineers to build new microservices (e.g., for the "Florence Academy" or "Rota" products) that share types with your frontend, creating a unified, faster development cycle.
