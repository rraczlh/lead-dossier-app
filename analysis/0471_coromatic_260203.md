# 1. DATA VALIDATION (Excel vs. Current 2026)

| Data Point | Excel Value | Current (Jan 2026) | Verification Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | 1,000,000,000 SEK | **~3,800,000,000 SEK** (Group Level) | [Coromatic Annual Reports / E.ON Infrastructure](https://coromatic.com) |
| **Key Decision Maker** | CIO | **Robin Carlsson** (Chief Solutions & Services Officer) | [Coromatic Management Team](https://coromatic.com/about-us/management/) |

> **Analyst Note:** While the input lists 1B SEK, Coromatic Group's consolidated revenue (Nordic) is significantly higher, approx. 3.8B SEK (~$360M USD). The "CIO" role is split between **Robin Carlsson** (Services/Solutions) and **Peter Sisell** (Strategy/Digital).

# 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX

**Type: Product Strategy**
**Signal Title: Critical Facilities Operations (CFOPS) Framework**
**The Evidence:** Coromatic has productized their operations into "CFOPS," a framework donated to the Open Compute Project. This service relies heavily on ITSM workflows to manage incidents in mission-critical environments (Data Centers).
**The Source:** [Coromatic CFOPS / Open Compute Project](https://coromatic.com)
**Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** ServiceNow / Incident Management

**Type: Regulatory Pressure**
**Signal Title: CSRD & Net-Zero Data Reporting**
**The Evidence:** Coromatic is aggressively marketing "Climate-smart data centers" and must comply with CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive). This requires extracting real-time power usage effectiveness (PUE) data from hardware to cloud dashboards.
**The Source:** [Coromatic Sustainability Report](https://coromatic.com/sustainability/)
**Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Data Science (Python/Pandas) & Azure Data Engineering

**Type: Strategic Partnership**
**Signal Title: Conapto & AI-Ready Data Centers**
**The Evidence:** Coromatic builds and services facilities for **Conapto**, which is expanding for AI workloads. AI infrastructure requires higher density cooling and monitoring, necessitating advanced observability stacks beyond standard BMS.
**The Source:** [Coromatic Customer Cases](https://coromatic.com/references/)
**Mapping-2-Localhost Service:** Observability (Grafana/Prometheus)

# 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **ServiceNow:** The backbone of their "Critical Facilities Operations" (CFOPS). They use it to manage SLAs for hospital and data center power uptime.
*   **Azure:** The primary cloud environment for their digital services and customer portals (Coromatic is a Microsoft Partner).
*   **Python:** Essential for the energy analytics and "Smart Building" data pipelines they are building for sustainability reports.
*   **.NET:** The likely backend for their legacy internal tooling and customer-facing portals.

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **BMS to IoT Migration:** They currently use traditional BMS (Building Management Systems). There is a massive opportunity to migrate this data into **Azure Digital Twins** or **Time-Series Databases** (InfluxDB/Prometheus) which we support.
*   **Salesforce:** Used for CRM; potential for integration with ServiceNow for seamless Sales-to-Support workflows.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **Physical Infrastructure:** UPS hardware, Diesel Generators, Cooling Units, and Cabling. We must explicitly avoid "Field Service" discussions and focus on the *software* that monitors these assets.

# 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The CFOPS Optimization**
*   **The Trigger:** Their "CFOPS" framework is their competitive advantage in the Data Center market.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Scaling CFOPS to hundreds of new clients creates a massive ServiceNow backlog—customizing workflows for each client's specific hardware setup is slow and expensive.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Robin, we can deploy a dedicated **ServiceNow Engineering Pod** to automate your client onboarding workflows. We handle the ITSM customization so your core team can focus on the physical infrastructure strategy."

**Conversation Starter 2: The CSRD Data Gap**
*   **The Trigger:** The 2026 CSRD requirements for detailed carbon reporting.
*   **The Logical Friction:** Extracting clean data from legacy cooling systems and UPS units into a unified report is a data engineering nightmare, often done manually via Excel.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "We can build the **Azure Data Pipelines (Python/Databricks)** to ingest real-time PUE data from your sites directly into your sustainability dashboards, automating your CSRD compliance."

**Conversation Starter 3: AI-Ready Observability**
*   **The Trigger:** The shift to high-density AI data centers (like the Conapto project).
*   **The Logical Friction:** Traditional BMS alerts aren't fast enough for AI compute loads. A cooling failure melts a GPU rack in seconds, not minutes.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "We can modernize your monitoring stack by layering **Prometheus and Grafana** on top of your existing BMS, giving your AI customers the sub-second observability they demand."
