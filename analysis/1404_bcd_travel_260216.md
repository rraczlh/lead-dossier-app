## 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX (2025-2026 Signals)

**[Strategic Partnership]: Core Systems Modernization (Jan 2026)**
*   **The Evidence:** BCD explicitly partnered with Amadeus in Jan 2026 to modernize their "TripSource Profile Management System" (TSPM). They are moving from legacy self-built systems to "cloud-native engineering" to handle complex traveler profiles.
*   **The Source:** [Amadeus & BCD Travel Modernization Announcement](https://amadeus.com)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Software Engineering** (Legacy Modernization)

**[AI Implementation]: Agentic AI for Service Automation (July 2025)**
*   **The Evidence:** BCD expanded their partnership with "Oversee" to implement "agentic AI" across their operations. The goal is to automate email-based service requests and shell PNR creation, moving beyond simple chatbots to autonomous agents.

*   **Localhost Service Map:** **AI & ML** (Agents, GenAI)

**[Platform Engineering]: NDC FastTrack Initiative (Nov 2025)**
*   **The Evidence:** BCD joined Accelya’s "NDC FastTrack" program. They are actively building and integrating APIs to handle "New Distribution Capability" (NDC) content, which requires complex API orchestration between airlines and GDS.
*   **The Source:** [BCD Joins NDC FastTrack](https://www.bcdtravel.com/news)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Platform Development** (API Economy)

**[Data Product]: DecisionSource "Instant Query" Launch (Aug 2025)**
*   **The Evidence:** The internal data science team released "Instant Query," a feature allowing travel managers to query 450+ data points in real-time. This signals a maturity in their data warehouse but a potential need for scaling ETL pipelines as data volume grows.

## 3. SERVICES & STACK INTERSECTION

### ✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Service Matches)
**Platform Development (API Economy)**
*   **Evidence:** The shift to NDC (New Distribution Capability) is the single biggest technical challenge in travel. BCD is actively coding against fragmented airline APIs.
*   **Why it fits:** They need middleware that normalizes JSON/XML streams from Lufthansa, American Airlines, and British Airways into a single "TripSource" schema.
*   **Tech Validation:** Use of **REST APIs**, **Accelya**, and **Microservices** architecture.

**AI & ML (Agentic Workflows)**
*   **Evidence:** The "Oversee" partnership proves they have budget for AI that *does* things (Agentic), not just *reads* things.
*   **Why it fits:** They are automating "Shell PNR creation" and "Email Service Requests." Localhost can pitch custom agents for complex re-booking scenarios that off-the-shelf tools can't handle.

### ⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent/Upsell)
**Cloud Services (Cloud-Native Refactoring)**
*   **The Angle:** While they partner with Amadeus for *profile* management, their "DecisionSource" analytics platform is likely running on heavy data infrastructure (Azure/Snowflake).
*   **The Pitch:** "Your move to cloud-native for TripSource is great. We can apply those same FinOps and auto-scaling principles to your DecisionSource analytics pipelines to reduce Azure spend."

**DevOps & Cybersecurity (Securing Traveler Data)**
*   **The Angle:** With "Instant Query" exposing PII (Traveler Locations) to managers, security audits are critical.
*   **The Pitch:** "As you expose real-time query capabilities to clients, we can perform 'Infrastructure as Code' security audits to ensure GDPR compliance isn't breached by a rogue query."

### ❌ The Mismatch (Out of Scope)
**Hardware / IoT Manufacturing**
*   **Reason:** BCD focuses on software and service. While they track travelers, they do not manufacture the tracking hardware or mobile devices.

## 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE

**Starter 1: The "NDC" Complexity Trigger**
"Yannis, I saw BCD joined the NDC FastTrack program in November. Most TMCs we speak with are struggling not with the *connection*, but with the *normalization* of that data into their legacy mid-office systems. Are you building that middleware layer in-house, or looking for acceleration partners?"

**Starter 2: The "Agentic" Scale Trigger**
"Your move to Agentic AI with Oversee for email automation is a smart pivot. The next bottleneck we usually see is 'Hallucination in Policy Application'—where the AI books a flight that is technically available but violates a complex client-specific rule. How are you validating agent actions against client policy contracts?"

**Starter 3: The Data Modernization Trigger**
"The 'Instant Query' feature in DecisionSource is a massive value-add for travel managers. However, real-time querying usually spikes cloud data costs. We've helped similar data-heavy platforms optimize their Snowflake/Azure SQL architecture to keep query costs flat while volume doubles."
