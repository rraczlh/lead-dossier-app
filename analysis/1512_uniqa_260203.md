### 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX (High-Signal Breadcrumbs)

**[Cloud Modernization]: Guidewire Cloud Migration**
*   **The Evidence:** Uniqa is actively migrating its core P&C systems to **Guidewire Cloud** on Azure to improve agility and reduce technical debt. This is a massive, multi-year initiative requiring specialized integration skills.
*   **The Source:** [Guidewire Customer Success Story - Uniqa](https://www.guidewire.com/customers/uniqa)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** Azure Cloud Engineering, Java/Integration Services.

**[Digital Product]: Mavie Health Ecosystem Scaling**
*   **The Evidence:** Uniqa’s subsidiary, **Mavie Next**, is aggressively hiring for **React, Next.js, and Node.js** roles to build out their "Health Ecosystem" platform (telemedicine, home testing). This differs from the core insurance stack (Java/Angular).
*   **The Source:** [Mavie Next / Uniqa Careers - Full Stack Developer](https://www.uniqagroup.com/karriere)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** React/Next.js Pods, Node.js Backend Development.

**[Data Infrastructure]: The "UNIQA Data Platform"**
*   **The Evidence:** The company has standardized on **Azure Databricks** and **Snowflake** for its central data lakehouse to support "UNIQA 3.0" analytics goals. They are actively recruiting Data Engineers with Python/SQL skills.
*   **The Source:** [Uniqa IT Services - Data Engineering Jobs](https://www.uniqa-gsc.sk/career)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** Data Engineering (Databricks/Snowflake), Python.

**[Core Systems]: msg.Insurance Suite Implementation**
*   **The Evidence:** While P&C is on Guidewire, Uniqa is implementing **msg.Insurance Suite** for its Life and Health segments, creating a complex dual-vendor core environment that requires significant middleware/API orchestration.
*   **The Source:** [msg.Insurance Suite Success Story - Uniqa](https://www.msg-insur-it.com)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** Java/Spring Boot (Integration Layer), API Development.

### 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Backend:** **Java** (Core Insurance), **Node.js** (Digital/Mavie), **Spring Boot**.
*   **Frontend:** **React** & **Next.js** (Mavie), **Angular** (Internal Enterprise Apps).
*   **Cloud & Data:** **Azure** (Primary), **Databricks**, **Snowflake**, **PostgreSQL**.
*   **Mobile:** **React Native** (Customer Apps).

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **Observability:** They use **Dynatrace** heavily (Source: Dynatrace Case Study). *Opportunity:* We support Grafana/Prometheus; we can offer "Observability Modernization" or managed services for their existing Dynatrace setup if we have the capability, or propose open-source alternatives for cost reduction (aligned with UNIQA 3.0 cost goals).
*   **Core Systems:** They use **Guidewire** (Gosu/Java) and **msg.Insurance Suite**. *Opportunity:* We don't do core vendor implementation, but we *do* build the **Integration Layer** (APIs, Microservices) that connects these monoliths to their digital frontends (React/Next.js).

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **Gosu Language:** Specific to Guidewire configuration. (Unless we have niche specialists, avoid "Core Config" work).
*   **Mainframe:** Legacy systems likely still exist but are being retired; not a target for us.

### 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The "Mavie" Velocity Gap**
*   **The Trigger:** Their aggressive push into Health Tech (Mavie) using a modern stack (**Next.js/Node.js**) distinct from their corporate Java standard.
*   **The Friction:** Corporate IT often struggles to support "startup-speed" subsidiaries because their governance and hiring models are built for enterprise Java/Guidewire, not modern JS ecosystems.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Wolf-Christoph, we see Mavie is scaling its digital health platform on Next.js. Localhost can deploy dedicated **React/Node.js acceleration pods** that operate at 'startup speed'—bypassing the slower corporate hiring queues while adhering to your Group IT security standards."

**Conversation Starter 2: The "Dual-Core" Integration Headache**
*   **The Trigger:** Running **Guidewire** (P&C) and **msg.Insurance Suite** (Life) simultaneously.
*   **The Friction:** This creates a massive "spaghetti code" risk in the integration layer. Data fragmentation between these two monoliths usually kills the "360-degree customer view" promised in the UNIQA 3.0 strategy.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "With your dual-core strategy (Guidewire & msg), the battleground is the API layer. We specialize in building the **Spring Boot middleware** that abstracts these monoliths, giving your frontend teams a clean, unified API surface so they don't have to wrestle with legacy backend logic."

**Conversation Starter 3: Databricks ROI & Cost Control**
*   **The Trigger:** The "UNIQA 3.0" goal of significant admin cost reduction paired with heavy investment in **Azure Databricks**.
*   **The Friction:** Cloud data bills often spiral out of control during migrations, and finding senior Databricks engineers to optimize pipelines is difficult in the DACH region.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "We noticed your shift to a centralized Data Platform on Azure. Our Data Engineering practice focuses specifically on **Databricks optimization**—ensuring your pipelines are not just 'working' but cost-efficient, directly supporting your UNIQA 3.0 admin cost reduction targets."
