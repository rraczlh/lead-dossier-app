## 1. DATA VALIDATION (Excel vs. Current 2026)
| Data Point | Excel Value | Current (Feb 2026) | Verification Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | €1.6B | **€1.53B (FY 2024)** | [Preh FY2024 Results / Vogel.de](https://www.vogel.de/) |
| **KDM** | CTO | **Zhengxin "Charlie" Cai** | [Preh Press Release Dec 2024](https://www.preh.com/press) |
| **Status** | Active | **Interim CTO** | *Note: Former CTO Dr. Marcus Kneifel resigned Dec 2024 due to "strategic differences." CEO Charlie Cai is currently acting CTO.* |

## 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX
**[Strategic Shift]: CEO assumes CTO role following leadership exit (Dec 2024)**
*   **The Evidence:** Dr. Marcus Kneifel left abruptly due to "strategic differences" regarding the company's direction during the industry crisis. CEO Charlie Cai has taken over technical leadership temporarily.
*   **The Source:** [Preh Press Release: Management Change](https://www.preh.com/press)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Outsourcing Services** (Interim leadership support / High-level architectural consultancy).

**[Product Launch]: Bidirectional Onboard Charger (V2G) Launch (Sept 2025)**
*   **The Evidence:** Preh presented a new Onboard Charger at IAA Mobility supporting Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), V2L, and V2H. This requires complex power electronics software and grid communication protocols.
*   **The Source:** [Hanser Automotive: Preh E-Mobility Solutions](https://www.hanser-automotive.de/)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **IoT & Process Automation** (Smart Grid integration / Embedded Control).

**[Restructuring]: "Cost Discipline" & 420 Job Cuts (2024-2025)**
*   **The Evidence:** Due to a 9% revenue drop, Preh initiated a restructuring program cutting ~420 jobs at the HQ to "improve competitiveness."
*   **The Source:** [Preh FY2024 Financial Report](https://www.preh.com/investors)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Outsourcing Services** (Cost-efficient Nearshore Engineering teams to replace high-cost local headcount).

**[Hiring]: Software Development (Embedded & HMI)**
*   **The Evidence:** Active recruitment for "Development - Software" across Germany and Romania, specifically focusing on HMI systems and "Smart" surfaces (Glass/Light guide tech).
*   **The Source:** [Preh Careers Portal](https://www.preh.com/career)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **Software Engineering** (Embedded C++ / HMI Logic).

**[Compliance]: ISO 21434 Cybersecurity Focus**
*   **The Evidence:** As a Tier-1 supplier, Preh is mandating adherence to UNECE R155/R156 and ISO 21434 for all new control units (HMI/BMS).
*   **The Source:** [Preh Sustainability & Compliance Report](https://www.preh.com/sustainability)
*   **Localhost Service Map:** **DevOps & Cybersecurity** (Compliance Audits / Secure by Design).

## 3. SERVICES & STACK INTERSECTION

✅ **The Sweet Spot (Direct Service Matches)**
*   **Software Engineering (Embedded/HMI):** Preh's core business is the "Center Console 2025" and HMI interfaces. They are moving away from standard screens to "shy tech" (hidden icons under glass).
    *   *Why it fits:* They need low-level C++ logic to drive these novel displays and integrate with Android Automotive backends.
    *   *Tech Validation:* Use of **C++**, **Linux**, and **Real-time OS**.
*   **IoT & Process Automation:** The new Bidirectional Charger (V2G) is a pure IoT play. It needs to talk to the car (CAN/LIN) and the Grid (OCPP/ISO 15118).
    *   *Why it fits:* This is "Hardware Integration" defined.

⚠️ **The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent/Upsell)**
*   **Outsourcing Services (Managed Teams):**
    *   *The Angle:* They just cut 420 internal jobs in Germany to save costs. They *must* maintain output to service BMW/Ford contracts.
    *   *The Pitch:* "Replace fixed-cost local friction with flexible, high-velocity nearshore pods in Slovakia (Localhost). Same time zone, lower cost, no 'strategic differences'."
*   **Cloud Services (Data Ingestion):**
    *   *The Angle:* Their V2G chargers generate massive telemetry data for grid stabilization.
    *   *The Pitch:* "You have the hardware, but do you have the **Cloud Native** infrastructure to ingest 200ms frequency data for grid balancing? We build the Azure/AWS pipes for that."

❌ **The Mismatch (Out of Scope)**
*   **General Web Development:** They do not need marketing websites or e-commerce stores. Their "web" needs are strictly limited to internal tooling or HMI-embedded web views.

## 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE

**Starter 1: The "Interim CTO" Gap (High Risk/High Reward)**
"Mr. Cai, I noted your dual role as CEO and Interim CTO following the December restructuring. When leadership bandwidth is this compressed, 'keeping the lights on' in engineering often stalls innovation. Localhost can deploy a **Dedicated Engineering Pod** to handle the V2G software maintenance, allowing you to focus purely on the strategic turnaround without hiring expensive local headcount."

**Starter 2: The V2G Data Challenge**
"Your new Bidirectional Onboard Charger is a game-changer for the grid. However, most Tier-1s struggle with the **Cloud Ingestion** layer—handling the real-time frequency data (±2.5 Hz) required for grid stabilization. We specialize in building the **IoT & Analytics** pipelines that turn that hardware signal into a monetizable data stream for utilities."

**Starter 3: Cost-Neutral Modernization**
"I read about the 'Cost Discipline' initiative and the headcount reduction in Bad Neustadt. The paradox is that OEM demands for **Cybersecurity (ISO 21434)** haven't decreased. We offer a 'Compliance-as-a-Service' model—auditing and patching your legacy codebases for UNECE R155 compliance at a fraction of the cost of maintaining a full internal security team."
