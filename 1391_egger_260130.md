| Data Point | Excel Value | Current (Jan 2026) | Verification Source (Title/Link) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | €4.0B | **€4.13 Billion** | [EGGER Annual Financial Report 2024/25](https://www.egger.com/en/company/news/financial-year-2024-2025) |
| **Key Decision Maker** | CIO | **Hannes Mitterweissacher** (CTO) | [EGGER Group Management Overview](https://www.egger.com/en/company/about-us/management) |

### 2. THE EVIDENCE BOX
*High-Signal Technical Breadcrumbs (2025-2026)*

**[Infrastructure]: Kubernetes & Cloud Native Migration**
*   **The Evidence:** EGGER has standardized its core data center on SUSE Linux and recently migrated its on-premises container environment to **Rancher Prime (Kubernetes)** to manage rapid growth in microservices.
*   **The Source:** [SUSE Customer Success Story: EGGER Group](https://www.suse.com/success/egger/)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** Kubernetes, Docker, Java (Backend Modernization).

**[Expansion]: Greenfield IT for Lexington, NC Plant**
*   **The Evidence:** Active recruitment for **Controls Engineers** and **Electrical Engineers** for the new Lexington, NC facility. This implies a massive need for SCADA-to-Cloud data pipelines (Industrial IoT) to support their "Digital Factory" initiative.
*   **The Source:** [EGGER Careers: Controls Engineer (Lexington, NC)](https://www.egger.com/en/company/careers/job-search)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** C#, Azure IoT, Python (Data Engineering).

**[Mobile]: Consumer App Development (React Native)**
*   **The Evidence:** The "EGGER Decorative Collection" mobile app was developed using **React Native**. Historical data indicates reliance on external agencies/freelancers for this frontend work, presenting a consolidation opportunity.
*   **The Source:** [Toptal Portfolio / App Store Data](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/egger-decorative-collection/id1493486800)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** React Native, TypeScript.

**[Strategy]: Net Zero 2050 Data Pipeline**
*   **The Evidence:** EGGER's "Climate Strategy 2050" mandates rigorous Scope 1, 2, and 3 tracking. This requires integrating disparate manufacturing data (SAP) into a unified data lake for sustainability reporting.
*   **The Source:** [EGGER Sustainability Report 2024/25](https://www.egger.com/en/company/sustainability)
*   **Mapping-2-Localhost:** Python (Pandas/Polars), Azure Data Factory.

### 3. TECH STACK INTERSECTION

**✅ The Sweet Spot (Direct Matches):**
*   **Kubernetes (Rancher):** They are actively scaling containerized applications.
*   **Java:** The core language for their custom middleware and SAP extensions.
*   **Azure:** Used for identity management (ADFS migration) and likely their data analytics layer.
*   **React Native:** The framework of choice for their customer-facing mobile applications.
*   **C#/.NET:** Standard for their shop-floor manufacturing execution systems (MES) and machine interfacing.

**⚠️ The Expansion Opportunities (Adjacent Tech):**
*   **SAP BTP (Business Technology Platform):** They use SAP BTP. While we don't do ABAP, BTP allows "Side-by-Side Extensibility" using **Node.js** or **Java** on Cloud Foundry/Kyma (Kubernetes). This is a backdoor for Localhost to build SAP extensions without touching SAP core code.
*   **SUSE Linux:** They are a heavy SUSE shop. Our expertise in **Linux/Bash** scripting for DevOps automation is highly relevant here.

**❌ The Mismatch:**
*   **SAP ABAP:** Core ERP development is likely handled by internal teams or specialized SAP consultancies.
*   **Siemens S7/TIA Portal:** Low-level PLC programming is out of scope unless we are doing the data extraction layer (Edge).

### 4. THE STRATEGIC BRIDGE (Consultative Synthesis)

**Conversation Starter 1: The "Digital Factory" Data Gap**
*   **The Trigger:** Their active hiring of Controls Engineers in NC + the "Digital Factory" strategic pillar.
*   **The Friction:** Controls engineers build the machines, but they often struggle to get high-fidelity data *out* of the PLC and into the Cloud (Azure) for predictive maintenance without crashing the production line.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "We can deploy a **Python/Azure** engineering pod to build the 'Data Bridge' for your Lexington plant. We handle the IT/OT convergence layer—extracting data from your C# shop floor systems and piping it into Azure for your reliability engineers to analyze."

**Conversation Starter 2: Kubernetes Day 2 Operations**
*   **The Trigger:** The recent migration to SUSE Rancher for container management.
*   **The Friction:** Moving to Kubernetes is easy; *operating* it at scale (Day 2) is hard. Internal teams often get bogged down in upgrades, security patching, and cluster sprawl.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Now that you've migrated to Rancher, are your internal teams spending too much time on cluster maintenance? Localhost can provide a **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)** squad to manage your Kubernetes pipelines (GitHub Actions) and observability (Prometheus/Grafana), freeing your core Java devs to build features."

**Conversation Starter 3: The "Sidecar" Innovation Strategy**
*   **The Trigger:** Their heavy reliance on SAP S/4HANA combined with a need for agile mobile apps (React Native).
*   **The Friction:** Modifying SAP core is slow, expensive, and risky. But the business needs modern, fast mobile apps for customers *now*.
*   **The Partnership Angle:** "Instead of customizing SAP directly, we can build 'Sidecar' applications using **Node.js** and **React Native** that talk to SAP via API. This gives you the stability of the ERP with the speed of a startup—perfect for the next iteration of the Decorative Collection app."
